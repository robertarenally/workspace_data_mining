Opening with the Velvet Underground  classic ""All Tomorrow\'s Parties"", Connie grabs hold of the song  and never lets go. The band charges the opening chords with  intensity and skill, creating a 3-D wall of sound built from  electric guitars, clarinet and exotic percussion. Listening to  the next few tunes, you begin to realize that    La Strada   is no ordinary singer/songwriter debut  album.     La Strada   is truly an eclectic album. Each song  is a story, stylistically ranging from rock to jazz, retro-pop  to smoky torch song. Rarely before has there been a recording  that successfully covers so many different styles of music.  With   La Strada   Connie brings a new dimension to  alternative music.

Emotionally charged and deep in meaning, Clan Diah produces sways from indie rock to heavier alternative. It\'s no wonder their appeal to the college scene keeps growing. Clan Diah is eclectic, yet ironically maintains a balanced, cohesive sound. They flow through a whole gamut of styles and sounds, but each song is uncontrived and honest. This sophisticated approach makes for timeless music. Clan Diah is song oriented with a communication of both mood and thought. This Cincinnati based quartet capitalizes on dynamics all through their debut CD "" The Train Journey North ."" If you haven\'t heard them have a taste and enjoy the Cincinnati style cookin\'.        About the songs available on IUMA...     SKY SIGN : This tribute to the unseen fully explores the use of dynamics. It refers to the sense that we believe in many things not yet seen, or invisible. We can see the future by study of the past and we can see the invisible by the results it produces. This song has interesting changes in time signature and moods. It trips, it flies, it spirals out of control. What is communication but transfer of ideas and moods? Words too are invisible and yet still exist.    MIST COVERED MOUNTAINS : Simply Complicated and sadly beautiful. Christopher shows off some of his piping abilities on this piece. Originally composed by an unknown source in the early 1800\'s, this piece is sometimes rendered with Gaelic (trad. Scottish language) lyrics but more often the haunting melody is left alone to tell the tale of a traveler longing for the mist covered mountains of his home. This tune was a favorite of the late King George the VI and was played at his funeral. It was also played at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy. Highland bagpipes, acoustic guitar, and the distant harmonies of the whistles will leave an impression.    SYMBOL OF MY SHAME : Very Emotional! This song demonstrates the winding melodies and thick guitars. Listen hard and you\'ll hear Jay\'s marching band past. This song is rich in meaning. It refers to the moving irony of the feast of Christ\'s last meal. It was caused by man\'s failure, yet caused man\'s redemption. He said it symbolized His death and His blood. He then gave thanks to God for it and ate it.            These three songs are only a taste of Clan Diah\'s independently released CD ""The Train Journey North"" which is available by sending $11.00 plus $2.00 postage and handling to....   Clan Diah  265 Emming Street Apt. #3  Cincinnati, Ohio 45219         Some more stuff for those who care...    HISTORY OF CLAN DIAH   In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991 a few college friends started writing songs. Clan Diah, as a band started with the stereotypical ritual of arguing over what to name the band. They settled on ""Clan Diah"" which is an old Scottish phrase meaning ""the children of God."" This subtle reference to the divine nature of our humanity came from the Scottish influence of one of the members, Christopher McLennan, who is a nationally awarded bagpipe performer. After the name was chosen the band started playing out at local venues and coffee houses in the Cincinnati area.   Over the years the band did some quick recordings of songs for a demo tape. One song (""Matter of Time"") actually ended up on a nationally distributed compilation CD. With the confidence built by a very supportive local fan base, the success of the demo tape, and playing at a national music festival, the band embarked on its most ambitious endeavor yet...   In July of 1994, Clan Diah went into the studio to start recording its first full length compact disc. This self produced, independently released, and personally financed album is a statement of the band\'s abilities, commitment, and pro-active nature.   Clan Diah continues today to develop its loyal following. The band is presently shopping labels to give themselves the freedom to fully explore their potential. They wish you the best and hope you enjoy their work. See you on the ""Train Journey North.""        MEMBERS OF CLAN DIAH...     CHRISTOPHER MCLENNAN : Lead Guitar, Bagpipes, Penny whistles   Christopher is a 22 year old business major at the University of Cincinnati. From his young formative years he has played piano, violin, bagpipes, and the penny whistle. He was president of the Sycamore Orchestra and has won many national competitions on the bagpipes. He manages two apartment buildings, dabbles in the stock market, and is pipe major of the Caledonian Pipes and Drums of Cincinnati. He also has a certain preoccupation with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s ""Sherlock Homes.""    JAY HARNISH : Drums, Percussion, Exotic Coffee   Jay is a 22 year old CAD operator at an engineering firm in Cincinnati. He has played drums since the age of ten. His eclectic music tastes and artistic abilities add to the band\'s persona. Along with being a CAD operator, Jay is also a talented model maker and is very gifted in the art of Calligraphy (note the band\'s logo).    JEREMY PITTMAN : Bass Guitar   Jeremy is a 20 year old saltpacker. Yes, you read correctly, he moves bags of salt. Jeremy has the strongest back in the band. He loves to play bass. That is all he talks about. We try to distract him but all he\'ll do is play bass and work a day job to pay for more bass gear. We are, however, hopeful that he might actually spend his money on something else: He\'s thinking of getting a tattoo.    KENDALL FAULL : Lead Vocals, Guitar   Kendall is a 23 year old college graduate. He has a bachelor of Arts in Ancient Hebrew and Greek literature. He also has a minor in public communications. He has been involved in the art of song writing for eight years. He is the author and voice of the lyrics and melodies. He enjoys poems, proverbs, and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Since graduation he has worked several jobs including being a bicycle courier in downtown Cincinnati. Mountain biking has been his hobby of choice stemming back to his youth as an amateur BMX racer.        General Band Information...    Members: Christopher, Jay, Jeremy, Kendall.

""This crazy chick should turn VH-1 on its ear."" --  The Music Paper       Mary Ellen Bernard  just doesn\'t know how to fit in. Her debut  recording   Point of Departure   was described by a New York radio  personality as ""Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman."" (Huh?)

And they have ... at WXPN in Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the ""Z-100 Morning Zoo"" in New York city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.) And listeners love it.   On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows. Here, the Patty Larkin song ""Caffeine"" is a full-fledged big-band number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion, horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled -- with permission, of course.) ""We tried desperately to use every musician in New York,"" Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. ""We didn\'t, but you still get your money\'s worth.""   Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem, PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and festivals. She\'s opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women.   Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin), her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet ballads and her signature ""wacky production numbers."" ""Caffeine"" has become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration ""Let\'s Talk Dirty in Hawaiian."" Recently some original tunes have entered this category as well. ""My mission is to disprove the theory that no one ever laughs in a folk club,"" she states. ""I\'ll be working on jazz clubs next.""    Order NOW!

"b'     Distant Cousins                                                  Distant Cousins                 Elvis Did Karate                           (Excerpt 120k, 120k / Full song 2.5 mins, 2.02M, 2.70M)          College/Indie/Lo-Fi ,   Pop                         Only rarely does one come upon a distant relative that at once becomes a familiar friend, possessing shared secrets that never cease to beguile. Such is the case of  Twice Removed , the astonishingly mature debut from New York\'s  distant cousins .  Like their moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag of tricks they display on  Twice Removed .    First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive.  While the playful cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on closer inspection  Twice Removed \'s songs have dark roots that add depth to their danceability.  The album\'s opener, the raucous  ""Elvis Did Karate""  is a camp classic, but singer/songwriter/guitarist  Catherine Dail \'s husky wail imparts a simmering sensuality that\'s more Chrissie Hynde than downtown dilettante.  And  ""Gotta Fly,""  opening with awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head\'s ""Psycho Killer,"" turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end.  Even  ""Tambourine Girl""  a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and upbeat island  riddims , describes a lovable misfit unable to fit in, who ""does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when it comes to guitar playin\' that girl ain\'t got the touch.""    Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless  ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song.  Twice Removed  ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and  blue-eyed soul of  ""Pony""  (where Dail strongly tells her lover ""don\'t ride me baby, I\'m not your pony"") to sophisticated, jazzy pop like the smoky  ""Three Things""  and quietly longing  ""Love\'s Here Now"" .  distant cousins even manage to make having the  ""Minnesota Blues""  sound like fun; combining a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, ""Minnesota Blues"" suggests an unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors.    Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins\' familial musical virtuosity.  On ""Elvis Did Karate"" lead guitarist  Jon Diamond  brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches to a mariachi stroll on  ""Burning Words.""  As well,  Joe ""Mama"" Holland \'s harmonica provides a questioning  counterpoint to the lyrics on  ""No Exception""  and  Fred Gildes\'  subtle trombone shadings on ""Pony"" suggest an indecision hiding behind Dail\'s outwardly tough stance.  When necessary, distant cousins aren\'t afraid to bring in bongos, timbales, organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove.  And they\'re no strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that ornament the otherworldly jam session  ""Lucky Magnet.""     Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the in-betweens.  And from the sound of  Twice Removed , these cousins won\'t be distant for long.  Be sure to bring the family.         distant cousins\' ""Twice Removed"" has really hit the college radio waves with great success across the country.  The band has been on the road early in \'94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New Hampshire to rockin\' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere. On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter End, etc!  Enjoy!                          '",0

We are  attempting to provide information relative to aspects of the study of food science and nutrition, in general. This  will range from our K12 page (providing links to some of the K12 programs we are involved in) to our Food-Law page  (providing information and links to sites relating to food law).   Finally, we provide a variety of specific resources to support our students, staff and faculty. This would include  materials for specific classes, newsletters and other announcements, and whatever other aids and links we can develop  to make our lives more coherent.   These pages are continually growing and changing. We are trying to find ways to make our information more obvious and  readily useful. We are in the midst of a new metamorphosis. As the pages shift and reshape themselves, I welcome your  feedback.

T  he    D  epartment of    F  ood    S  cience and    N  utrition   offers  undergraduate  and   graduate  programs in Nutrition and in Food Science that prepare students  for careers related to food and health. Students graduate from the  undergraduate programs with a Bachelor of Science degree.  Students may  obtain either Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degrees from  graduate programs.   The studies of nutrition and food science cover the food continuum from  the producer to the consumer, including food processing, product  development, food distribution and marketing, its preparation and  serving, and the nutrition of people as it relates to health, the  prevention of chronic diseases and their treatment.     The Department of Food Science and Nutrition is jointly administered by  the  College of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Science (CAFES)  and  the  College of Human Ecology (CHE)   and the Food Science Program and the Nutrition Program are open to  students registered in either College.

Lou Reed and  Rosanne Cash rolled into one.""  Spin  magazine called Barbara\'s first album   Scissors   one of the best albums of the  decade. In the  Gavin  Report , musician Robyn Hitchcock named    Scissors   one of his top ten  favorites along with albums by Roxy Music, REM, Richard Thompson, and Elvis Costello. The  Village Voice  said ""Barbara Manning can make waves in a sea of sarcasm with introspective pretty songs about heavy shit. Her voice makes the edge seem like a place to warm yourself....her Nick Drake dread was cut with punk derision, her Suzanne Vega lilt was frosted with anxiety and her folky ear was  full of Wire and the Fall.""     Scissors  , originally released in 1988 on vinyl, was out of print for several years. As a special bonus, the CD and cassette formats of   One Perfect Green Blanket   includes all ten cuts  from the   Scissors   LP as well. Guest musicians helping out on the album include Kim  Osterwalder from Flophouse on cello, Melanie Clarin from Harm Farm on drums, and Steve Michner from Big Dipper on bass. Barbara has developed a strong cult following over the past several years with  her frequent live shows on both coasts. Barabara\'s music is regularly heard on college radio across the country.

Alston Ave. Durham NC 27713  tel: (919) 361-2277 fax: (919) 361-2290   Table of Contents      Company Profile     People at RTP     MicroCrystal      Technology Profile     Advantages of MicroCrystals Technology     MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes     Oral Availability     Payload Capacity     Sustained Release     Immediate Release     Toxicity     Marketing Exclusivity     Conclusion         Company Profile   RTP is a technology development company.  The primary business focus of RTP is to acquire, develop, and out-license novel pharmaceutical products and technologies that offer significant medical and health care benefits.  Among other innovations, the  MicroCrystal(TM)  drug delivery system for water-insoluble drugs is RTP's flagship technology.    ToC      MicroCrystal     Technology Profile   MicroCrystal(TM) technology consists of encapsulation of a water-insoluble pharmaceutical agent in natural or semi-synthetic phospholipids. The final product is a very fine aqueous suspension of submicron-sized (0.3 to 1.0 micron) phospholipid-coated drug -- MicroCrystals. The components used in MicroCrystal technology are biocompatible and are classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe. Both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms are available.   The concept of using phospholipids for drug delivery has intrigued scientists for decades. After years of research, RTP has successfully devised a lipid-based drug delivery system for oral, parenteral, or topical administration of hydrophobic compounds.      ToC    Advantages of MicroCrystal Technology   The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offer many advantages over other drug drug delivery systems. These advantages ranges from payload capacity to marketing exclusivity. RTP is committed to the MicroCrystal drug delivery system.    ToC    MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes   Unlike liposomes, which are primarily meant to entrap water-soluble agents, MicroCrystal formulations are ideal for water-insoluble drugs.     MicroCrystal(TM)     Inner core is hydrophobic   Lipid chains point inward   High payload   Extended shelf life   Less expensive to manufacture   Not retained by the RES     Liposomes     Inner core is hydrophilic   Phosphate groups point inward   Relatively low payload capacity   Limited shelf life   Relatively expensive to manufacture   Retained by RES      The goal of a drug delivery system is to provide a patient-friendly formulation that is capable of delivering medically relevant amounts of drug. The versatility and reliability of the MicroCrystal technology provide many advantages over formulations that employ organic solvents and detergents to achieve adequate drug payloads.    ToC    Oral Availability   Improvement if oral availability using MicroCrystal technology has been demonstrated in dog and rat models with various drugs that are known to have poor oral availability. For example, MicroCrystal-formulated acyclovir in a cross-over study with sonicated bulk suspensions. In animal models, the bioavailability of acyclovir increased by 76%, and the bioavailablity of cefuroxime increased by 385%.    ToC    Payload Capacity   MicroCrystal technology produces high concentrations (up to 200 mg/mL) of physiologically compatible oral and parenteral formulations. MicroCrystal formulations may be lyophilized for subsequent reconstitution, pressed into tablets, or filled into capsules.    ToC    Sustained Release   Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of MicroCrystal formulations provide a tissue-compatible, sustained release lasting 12 to 96 hours. The slow release pattern results from encapsulation of the raw drug with phospholipids. Additional advantages of MicrCrystal sustained release include consistent blood levels of drug and high tissue compatibility.    ToC    Immediate Release   MicroCrystal technology delivers immediate release of drug through intravenous dosing. The rapid dilution of MicroCrystals improves the binding process of drug to plasma proteins.     ToC    Toxicity   Pilot intravenous toxicity sudies in rats show that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of MicroCrystal formulations are identical to those seen with drugs that are not formulated using MicroCrystal technology. Additionally, in an acute toxicity study in rabbits (Draize Test), MicroCrystal-formulated drugs failed to produce significant irritation. These results indicate that no additional toxic effects are produced by the components of the MicroCrystal formulations.    ToC    Marketing Exclusivity   Through extensive U.S. and internationally issued and pending patents, MicroCrystal techology offers a patentable drug delivery system. For drugs approaching off-patent status, MicroCrystal technology offers a potential patent-extension strategy. MicroCrystal formulations can be commercially manufactured using currently available equipment and excipients.    ToC    Conclusion   Versatility and reliability are essential elements of successful drug delivery systems. The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offers the following advantages:    applicable to all dosing routes   reduces toxicity of parenteral formulations by eliminating the need for organic solvents or extreme pH   improved oral bioavailability offers the opportunity to convert parenteral-only formulations to oral formulations   may lower the required oral dose for drugs that are poorly absorbed   enables the commercialization of otherwise therapeutically effective drugs whose development has been halted due to difficulties in formulation or lack of appropriate bioavailability   the manufacturing process is relatively simple and is readily amenable to commercial scale production   extensive patent protection offers a unique product-line extension strategy    Call Research Triangle Pharmaceuticals to learn if the MicroCrystal drug delivery system is the solution to your formulation challenge.

"b""     Welcome to BITMed               Welcome to the BITMed Simulation Server at the University of California, San Diego.  This server is unique in that the WWW hypertext is interleafed with true complex systems simulations of biological, chemical and physical systems.  We are presently building several virtual environments for the rational design of clinical trials and wetlab experiments. Our current simulators are invaluable tools for the teaching of neuroimmunology and HIV-induced disease to students at both the highschool and university levels.  We also support a number of   conferences .        Do you have the   necessary software   to run simulations on this server?        Topics of Interest           BITMed Research Overview     A synopsis of the laboratory's general mission as well as the   Directory of BITMed Members .       The Cybermouse Project     A collection of random field  simulators  for analyzing tissue samples of the murine animal model.   Applications  to the rational design of preclinical trials and to  AIDS research  are discussed.        The Virtual Wetlab     An environment for discussion, simulation, shared analysis, and the teaching of biomedicine.        The Virtual Reading Center     Mockup for testing interactive ophthalmologic research       Random Fields & Cellular Automata     Background information on random fields with sample cellular automata  simulators .       BITMed Library     BITMed publications, slides, press releases, and access to  BITMed's FTP site.  We also added a small number of links on how to write hypertext.       Conferences     Information concerning conferences on virtual reality, telemedicine, and other topics relating to BITMed.       TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ZONE      This newest addition to our server transfers various technologies developed in our laboratory into the market place.  Because it is so new, this section is still under construction.

Goudy quotes re: sheep rustling. The    &gt;first (less common; I place it first only because I had read it first) is    &gt;""Anyone who would letterspace blackletter would steal sheep."" The second    &gt;is the same quote except about lower case rather than blackletter. I am    &gt;inclined to believe that the first is the ""real"" quote and the second a    &gt;misquote. I have seen specific citation (occasion, date, etc.) on the first,    &gt;although I have not seen contemporary first person citation. Also, we are    &gt;basically conservative beings and tend to believe that whatever we saw first    &gt;is right, original, proper, etc. and any subsequent variation is wrong,    &gt;derivative, heresy, etc. (In other words, I have no idea whether I believe    &gt;it simply because it is something I believe.)    &gt;    &gt;I haven\'t made any real effort to hunt this down, so don\'t go to any trouble,    &gt;but if someone can answer this easily, I\'d appreciate it.    &gt;    &gt;Thanks,    &gt;    &gt;Gunnar    &gt;    &gt;Gunnar Swanson Design Office    &gt;739 Indiana Avenue, Venice, California 90291-2728 USA    &gt;310/399-5191  fax:310/399-2675    &gt;    &gt;                                     |||                                   (0-0)  oOO-*-*-*-*-*(_)   | Peter D.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly      Perhaps she'll die.  I knew an old lady who swallowed a spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly      Perhaps she'll die.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a dog Oh what a hog! To swallow a dog, She swallowed the dog to catch the cat She swallowed the cat to catch the spider That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her She swallowed the spider to catch the fly I don't know why she swallowed the fly      Perhaps she'll die.

"b' SOP FOR ANTIBODY PRODUCTION SHEEP      Sheep have been tested negative via florescent antibody      technique for Q-fever by the vendor.  Sheep will be retested      upon arrival by LAR using elisa technique.     No women of childbearing years will work with the sheep.       Technicians will be assigned to the sheep which will be housed      in the large animal cubicle.   The room will remain locked during the day and will be signed with ""Restricted Entry"".     Technicians will care for the sheep as the last duty of the      day.  The use of masks is strongly recommended.  Technicians      will launder the uniforms each day and wipe shoes with a      bleach solution.  Technicians should shower prior to leaving      the facility.     The animals will be housed on raised wire caging.  The pens      will be hosed down daily by a technician wearing LAR provided      uniforms, disposable gloves, shoes that remain at the animal      facility.     Contaminated surfaces will be disinfected with 1:100 dilution      of household chlorine bleach that contains 5.25% hypochlorite.     The animals will be fed alfalfa cubes rather than hay to      minimize potential contamination.  The sheep will be sheared      prior to purchase.  Male sheep or non pregnant females will be      used.     Medical Monitoring Procedures:   No individual will work with      sheep without a current serum reference sample on file, as      well as having met all other requirements of the Medical      Monitoring Program.     A training session to inform the affected LAR staff of the      potential hazards of Q-fever and the symptoms most often      associated with the illness will be provided.     Personnel will be advised to seek medical attention if they      develop a  febrile illness compatible with that of Q-fever .

"b'    Redbug                Funky Nassau                           (Excerpt 154k, 232k / Full song 3.5 mins, 2.51M, 5.01M)          College/Indie/Lo-Fi ,   Country ,   Punk                                        Members (This time):                 Blair Barnette: Vocals, Bass, Guitar                Bill Bartling:  Vocals, Guitar, Mandolin, Lyrics                Andrew Dalio:   Acoustic and Electric Bass Guitar                Erik Lievano:   Drums   Redbug hatched about three years ago when Bill started playing a solo acoustic gig after leaving a six year tenure with Central Florida\'s mid-1980\'s trend-setters, Braille Closet (of which Erik was also a member).  After three independent releases on the Figurehead label, he felt that it was time to focus on writing lyrics and music that was a little more raw and a little less serious than what Braille Closet was doing.     In early 1993, Bill started the Canned Corn label.  The first release in Spring of 1993 was Redbug\'s ""Blue Light Special"" b/w ""Downtown"" 7-inch.  The single received good airplay in a few markets and none in a lot.  Redbug played a few shows with various members: drummer Brian Maguire (currently with Jacksonville\'s Dave Ronan and the Hootowls) and bassist Andrew Dalio (also of Disco Biscuit).  Blair had been working on a solo project and was recruited to sing on the record and play bass on a mini-tour since Andrew\'s other band keeps him real busy.    The session for the current album, ""No Muffins For Shadow!,"" started as a session for another 7-inch.  Engineer Mark Ignoffo had worked with Smashing Pumpkins in their early days, and the band was impressed with a lot of the music coming out of his studio, Reel Time.  Mark didn\'t know what to think of Redbug at first.  The band didn\'t care.  They just wanted to take advantage of his 20 hours for $500.00 special.  Two of the songs on the album, ""Hush Puppy"" and ""Steely Cowsdell,"" were improvisational jams that ended up on the record.  Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple\'s ""Highway Star"" and Pearl Jam\'s ""Black.""  ""Blue Light Special"" and ""Downtown"" were remixed and included on the disc also.  ""Astro-Manta-Ray"" is a tribute to one of the band\'s faves, Man or Astro-Man.  The song ""Funky Nassau"" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush.     Redbug\'s music was described in Minneapolis\' YOUR FLESH as ""proficient country-dork spoo.""  Charlotte\'s THE INDIE FILE described them as ""They Might Be Giants with some real talent."" The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52\'s and X.  They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call \'em cow-dork-punk.

Thorsnes, Bartolotta, McGuire & Padilla  Fifth Ave. Financial Center, 11th Floor  2550 Fifth Avenue  San Diego, CA 92103   Excerpted from an interview with Ms. Karen Eliot, editor of  BULLET TRAIN :    When and where did the band coalesce?    \t\t Hungry Ghost  began in 1937 near Brussels, but the band really began creating in earnest about a year ago.  Our home base is San Francisco, but Ulbrecht recently moved to Moscow for a two-year stint posing as an American attorney.  Bhopal coordinates his efforts from San Diego, California because he likes to surf with the sharks.    How would you describe the music?    \t\tWe consider our stuff pretty diverse.  We strive to create ambient soundscapes and sound collages with an ethnic-industrial twist.    How does the band create the music?    \t\tWe do a lot of free forming.  Most times we start with sound clips taken from the urban environment that surrounds us and then mush \'em together with guitars, percussion, samplers and synthesizers.  A lot of times we do long, improvisational jam sessions and take out short clips for further manipulation.   \t\tOther times, we have a particular mood or idea in mind and create songs around this concept with whatever sound is handy at the time.   \t\tWe work well together; everyone has a finger in the creation of a song.    Where do you do your creating?    \t\tWe have our own studio, called DS2 (Death of a Supermodel or 2) here in San Francisco.  It\'s clean and warm and has everything we require.  The digital age has made us self-sufficient in our creative efforts.    Do you have any recordings available yet?    \t\tWe  have two jukebox 45s floating around.  One is a single with two cuts:   ""Maimana Casque""  and  ""Quechua Click.""   Recently, we cut a joint single with friends from Portland, Oregon.  Our cut is called  ""Miles.""   On the flip side is a band called  Compost .   \t\tAround August 1994, we\'ll be releasing our first CD, which is entitled   ""Brownout at the Spectacle.""                     These items are available through our label, Galivant Media in San Francisco.  You can mail order all of it.    Any other projects in the works?    \tYeah . . .  We have some videos in the works.  We\'ve been shooting a lot of Super 8mm film, which is a truly wonderful medium.  Very grainy and great texture; quite a contrast to the sterility of most other formats.  When a song gives us particular inspiration, we create some visual images to accompany it.  We\'re planning on distributing the videos through Galivant Media, and we have plans to air the videos on  OFFLINE , which is a public access program distributed on networks around the United States.   \tWe\'re working on a soundtrack for a public access film about graffiti art in subway tunnels.  It\'s in the works...   \tWe\'re also working with multimedia artists who produce CD-ROMs.  The group is called Cafe-E, and they\'re in New York.  We provide them with ""content,"" as it\'s called in the venacular.    Do you have any plans to tour?    \t\tNot as yet, but we\'re not averse to live gigs.  We want to wait until there is sufficient interest in our music before we venture forth from the comfortable confines of DS2.  When we do decide to tour, we\'d like to start in Europe.  That way we can tour and vacation at the same time.  We feel no pressure though.    Is there any political bent in the music?    \t\tJust the usual smash the State stuff.  We don\'t use lyrics as such, so the sound textures are more open to interpretation than the straight narrative stuff in most music.  This drives some people crazy, but we expect each listener to interpret the soundscapes in their own way based on what they\'re thinking or feeling at the time.   We definitely have our own political agendas, but they aren\'t essential to our musical agendas.  \x1a                      '",0

L. Porter     J. L. Porter \'s California is Central Valley tule fog on I-5, grunion runs on Windansea beach in La Jolla, rows of Bart Simpson banks on Tijuana\'s main drag. It\'s a world of weekend road trips, beach parties, and college football games. And, it\'s where love and innocence are found, and lost, and found again, someplace between a margarita and a forgotten Elvis movie.          Porter\'s debut CD,  Viva La Revolucion!  (on independent label Permanent Records Del Mar), covers all these bases and more. The 12 songs, performed by Porter (on his trusty Vox Wildcat guitar) and drummer  Brendan Kremer , feature stripped-down arrangements and a light, rockabilly feel. This disc is produced by Porter and fellow San Diego singer/songwriter ""Famous"" Steve Denyes.      Viva La Revolucion! has been lauded not only by San Diego\'s music press, but also in the pages of Nashville-based national magazine  Performing Songrwriter . Porter is a regular performer at San Diego\'s coffeehouses and bars.      Contact Porter via Permanent Records Del Mar\'s voice-mail at 619/454-1627; or by email at jlporter@cts.com.

"b'    Challenge      Challenge                 Soul Sirens                           (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 4.2 mins, 3.05M, 6.10M)          Rock                                     With the release of their self-titled debut album, on Splash International Records,  Challenge  proves to be a natural to shape melodic rock of today. The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals, catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs.    Challenge  is  Arno Verstappen  on guitar and  Allison Lindsay  on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends, who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckoned with.   Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fad oriented.  ""People have a hard time classifying our music because it\'s melodic, yet modern.  Lately people seem to think that in order to be current, music has to be alternative or grunge. It\'s interesting, then, to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rock bands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven\'t had to jump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to be in.   While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers, Allison feels the tide is turning, ""Artists like Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies and honest emotional vocals. It\'s time for us to cut out the gimmicks and get back to strong vocal lines and great songs.""   The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning to find the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally from Holland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (Guitar Institute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in town to form a band. ""There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. In Holland, the rock scene is very small,"" Arno clarifies. ""Few bands from there, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been a great inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out of playing music.""   Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians to different styles of music. How does that influence the band? ""Arno grew up listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots of feel and personality,"" explains Allison. ""My influence has come from the dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able to incorporate the best of both worlds into our own music.""   As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart as well as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, ""Everyone can find themselves in a love song but we also like to address other matters that inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that present themselves in everyday life. ""   Next to being the voice for  Challenge , Allison is gaining notoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening and Development) in Los Angeles.  Sabine Institute (established by renowned vocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocks brightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (Bad Co.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it\'s powerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy.   The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. ""We know the time is right for us,"" stresses Amo. ""Alternative and grunge have clearly textured the 90\'s with their realistic depictions of the life styles of today\'s youth.  However, history shows us that music trends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of the rising tide of new melodic rock.""

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.   I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.   Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documantaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.   I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.   I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradice Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for CIA. I sleep only once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I succesfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.  """,2

We are a neo-retro  band, playing both original music and covers. The song loaded onto  the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) is ""Get Even More,""  our personal advice for when things go bad: Don\'t get mad, don\'t  get even, get even more!   Deth Specula was formed by the crafty Malcom McCameron a couple of  years ago, and was an immediate hit with some of the band\'s friends.  Deth Specula is:       Kozmo  - rhythm guitar, vocals   Malcom McCameron  - lead guitar, management   Tim E Rotarian (aka Timmy, aka Timmer)  - lead vocals   RaSTrO!  - drums   Yam  - bass, vocals   Immediately after forming the band, Malcom booked the group on a series  of World Tours. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  However,  by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as  Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines,  was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster.  Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire  Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again war intervened and the tour was cancelled.   Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has  many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom\'s  dad\'s garage. For information on buying a t-shirt or other Specula  paraphernalia (buttons, bumper stickers), send e-mail to:    specula@deth.com    Ask to be subscribed to our monthly, on-line fanzine. New subscribers  get a free bumper sticker and a couple of buttons, and we\'ll send you  prices and other information.   A Tape? Yeah, we\'re making one. Trust me.

ABOUT THE DEMO SONG  Get Even More :    Get Even More  is for anyone who gets screwed over by Fate, The System, a lover, your boss, or whatever. We have always considered it a special song because members of Deth Specula, many of our fans, and close friends lost their jobs over the  last couple of years.   The song was recorded at the drummer\'s house on a Tascam 8-track  cassette. Vocals (Timmy, Yam and Kozmo) were recorded on the back  porch and the guitars (Malcom and Kozmo) were recorded in the bathroom.  Drums (RaStRo!) were recorded in the bedroom and the bass (Yam) was direct. Although it was mastered on cassette (oh joy), the  end result is not too shabby. However, we can\'t wait to rerecord this  in a studio.   Engineering was handled by Eric ""Sharky"" Davis, the Mystery Sixth Member of the band. Sharky takes care of our live sound, much of our recording, camera work, and general technical stuff. We couldn\'t have done it without him.    Get Even More  is one of our most popular live songs (along with our cover of ""Radar Love"" and our original ""(I\'m in Love with a)  Gutterslut."" We play it just as well live as on tape, in case you were wondering. :-)     by Robert Lord of the IUMA staff                        December 29, 1993     I Wanna Be Updated  is Deth Specula\'s bonus song for the IUMA. It\'s a spoof on the Ramones song  I Wanna Be Sedated  to reflect what it\'s like to working for a software company. Here\'some lyrics for example:      Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours to go,      I wanna be updated.    Nothing to do, nowhere to go,      I wanna be updated.     Get me to the trade show,      put me on a plane.    Send it to me Fed Ex,    before I go insane.    I can\'t control my budget,    can\'t drink away the pain,    Oh no no no no!

"b""         Bibliography Feral Goats             FERAL GOATS IN AUSTRALIA: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY   PREPARED BY JUDITH NEWLAND  B.V.Sc., Grad. Dip. LIM   1994   Contact: c/- ANCA Library,  ph (06) 250 0205   INTRODUCTION   PREFACE   The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water. These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental menace.   The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia. The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia. As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk, and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free or escaped to form the basis of today's feral herds.   This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia. Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals, conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts of agricultural extension workers.   Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the development of an effective strategic management plan integrated with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned with the goat's role in destruction of native flora, competition with native fauna and erosion of the land.   In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These developments are all reflected by the material listed in this bibliography.   LEVEL   This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided with references on environmental impact.   LIMITATIONS   The bibliography was limited to material published in English about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography.   ARRANGEMENT   Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are listed together.

CAB ABSTRACTS     &quot;Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred. With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent 63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference, but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming extinct.&quot;   27. O'Brien, P. H.

Author's abstract:     &quot;Measurements indexing the mating system, home range, peri-parturient behaviour, and group size and composition of feral goats were used to compare studied populations. Geographically diverse populations were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour and mating systems.&quot;    Includes tabled results and bibliography.   28.

Author's abstract:     &quot;Home range of feral goats studied by radio-telemetry in a pastoral area in Western Australia were much larger than those found in most other studies. Home ranges of males were larger (ranging from 139.2 to 587.7 sqkm) than those of females, which ranged from 15.0 to 190.2sqkm. Excursions outside the normal (90 percentile) home ranges were common. The home ranges of females were smaller during summer than winter. Male home ranges were of similar size in both seasons. Group structure and composition was highly variable. Implications of goat movements on management and control programmes are discussed.&quot;    Includes tables, figures and bibliography.   DISEASE IN FERAL GOATS   29. McKenzie, R. A., Green, P.

Presents results of a survey of 900 feral goats processed through an export abattoir in Western Australia demonstrating 3.1% of goats had caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) lesions in lymph nodes or organs while 13.7% had positive antibody titres. Survey was conducted to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved, reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination of entire carcase.   31. Batey, R. G., Speed, C. M., Kobes, C. J. (1986) &quot;Prevalence and distribution of caseous lymphadenitis in feral goats&quot;.

With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions. Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep.   32.

Author's summary:     &quot;Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%). The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs. Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation, while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17 antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.&quot;    Includes tabled results, references.   34. Williams, M. L.

The samples were dehaired, and measurements made of down diameter and its distribution. These were compared with measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution. The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities, but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable over years.&quot;   53.

CAB ABSTRACTS:     &quot;In 1980-87, approx. 78,000-120,000 goats were slaughtered annually in Western Australia, and of these 80% were feral goats, producing poor-quality carcasses. In view of increasing demand for high-quality goat meat, a development program for the production of meat from goats aged &lt;20 wk (capretto) began in 1988. For 689 kids, born in July, Aug. or early Sep., and slaughtered after 29 Aug., dressed carcass weight was 6-11 kg, representing a dressing percentage of 50 and 45 resp. for goats slaughtered before and after 18 Nov. A carcass classification scheme for capretto kids is outlined, and economic aspects are considered.&quot;   62. Wilson, G., McNee, A., Platts, P.

Author's abstract:     &quot;The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos, when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably be deleterious.&quot;    Includes tables, graph, figures and bibliography.   73.

Sheep, common name for a collection of grazing mammals that may be either wild or domesticated; the domesticated varieties are the most widely distributed kind of domestic animal, found in nearly all countries. Wild species are found in some areas of the world: the bighorn in western North America; Dall sheep in northern Canada and Alaska; the mouflon in Mediterranean countries; the Asian mouflon in western Asia; the urial in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and the argali in eastern Asia. Sheep were probably domesticated about 11,000 years ago in what is now northern Iraq, and they are thought to have descended primarily from the mouflon, although recent evidence suggests that species such as the Asian mouflon contributed to some of the modern breeds.

"b' Mastitis in Dairy Goats    Mastitis in Dairy Goats      J.K. Shearer & B. Harris, Jr.     Mastitis is a general term which refers to inflammation of the mammary gland, regardless of cause. It is characterized by physical, chemical, and usually bacteriological changes in the milk and by pathological changes in the udder. Early recognition and prompt treatment are important for limiting tissue damage and production losses. However, since treatment is often unrewarding, emphasis should be on mastitis control and prevention.

"b""       Desert Bighorn Sheep              Desert Bighorn Sheep      . . . . . Ovis canadensis mexicana        SIZE: Length of adult ram, 50 inches; weight, 200 lbs.     RANGE: Western and southern Arizona; Chihuahua and Sonora Mexico.     HABITAT: Rocky ridges and buttes.     DIET: Herbivore; grasses, herbs, shrubs, cactus and cactus fruit.     LIFE SPAN: 15 - 20 years.     STATUS: Once protected because of loss of habitat from human invasion and competition with domestic and exotic animals. Population now increasing and being reintroduced into former ranges.       ADAPTATIONS:       ANATOMY: Both sexes have horns. The female's horns are slimmer and shorter than the massive curled horns of the ram.  SENSES: Good peripheral and depth vision allows it to move over mountainsides without falling, and to maintain allaround surveillance of the area.  LOCOMOTION: The outer edge of the hoof is hard and enables the sheep to stand on the tiniest projection. The sole is soft and rubberlike, which helps it to cling to smooth surfaces and cushion the impact when jumping.  HABITS: The ram uses his horns in fighting for breeding rights. Horns may also be used to obtain food and as a defense against predators.  DEFENSE: Escapes into inaccessible rocky areas and fights with horns as weapon.  SOCIAL UNIT: Males live in separate herds from the females and the last year's young. At the start of the breeding season, the males fight for harems, and then, with their females, separate into new herds until that season is over.  MISC.: The Desert Bighorn can go without drinking water for extended periods. It relies on the moisture in vegetation, especially cactus.

Singer, songwriter, arranger and performer,  Eve B. , has been performing in the Boston area since 1990 when she formed and fronted the band, Eve\'n Up. The band played Eve\'s original tunes in Boston clubs for three years headlining and opening for other area locals before Eve decided to go solo in 1993.   Eve\'s musical past also includes the recording of a single on an independent European label in 1988, tours of Japan and France in 1988 and 1989, and more recently, performances with The Berklee College of Music Gospel Choir as a soloist in 1993.   Among Eve\'s various musical projects are several self-produced demos. The most recent, a four-song CD entitled, Innocence, is the culmination of her performing and songwriting experience. The four songs on the CD were written, produced and arranged by Eve B. with assistance from songwriter/ guitarist, Andrea Bensmiller, who previously performed in the Boston acoustic scene. Eve and Andrea merged their talents in 1994 to form EB Productions and have since continued to write, arrange and produce together.        The four tracks included on Innocence are ""Sexy Thing"", ""Innocence"", ""Invitation"", and ""Field of Hope"". Each tune showcases Eve\'s soulful, sultry, and purely original vocal style. Eve\'s creative and tasteful integration of vocal riffs and runs makes each tune breathe with soul and originality. The songs can best be described as a blend of pop and R&B with a strong gospel influence. Arrangements are characterized by the complex interweaving of keyboards and guitars, and lush harmonic backing vocals.

Mixed by Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer  Randy Sharp, everyone who appears on this album is an accomplished artist in their own right. Vocal production is by Rosemary Butler (Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt,  Jackson Browne, etc. ) , who also lends her legendary talents as backup vocalist, along with Arnold McCuller (Phil Collins, James Taylor, K.T. Oslin, etc.) and Linda Tillery (Bobby McFerrin, Linda Ronstadt).  Mike  Finnigan is heard on organ (Rolling Stones, Crosby, Stills & Nash, etc.), Andrew Woolfolk on saxes (Earth, Wind and Fire, Phil Collins), and Debra Dobkin (Bonnie Raitt) on percussion.  Don Kirkpatrick (Richard Marx, Amy Grant, etc.) blazes new flight paths with his amazing guitar work.  All remaining  keyboard work, as well as all of the basswork, is handled by Ms. Lindsay with her trademark grace and style ("" Best Bass Player "",   Reader\'s Choice Awards, Hot Wire magazine).  Together, these artists combine to weave a tapestry of sheer elegance.   Diane Lindsay\'s performing and recording credits (over 25 albums) include Dusty Springfield, The Limeliters, Randy Sharp, Holly Near, Cris Williamson, Linda Tillery,  Ferron and many more, as well as BAM Magazine and NAIRD awards as a producer.  Her songs have been recorded by many  artists, received awards from both the Billboard Song Contest and the  Music City Song Festival, and are featured on stage, radio, film and  television.             Diane Lindsay\'s songs brave the deepest and most vulnerable of human  experiences with a  telescopic eye for the truth.  But her unusual  range also visits the fun and sensuous with equal committment.

"b'        Wool Manufacturing: Shear Pain       Miscellaneous #6     Wool Manufacturing: Shear Pain              Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool. But without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes. The fleece provides effective insulation against both cold and heat. Until shears were invented in 1000 B.C., the only way to obtain wool was to ""pluck"" sheep during molting seasons. Breeding for continuous growth began after the advent of shears.(1)    Death ""Down Under""   With an estimated 148 million sheep, Australia produces eighty percent of all wool used worldwide. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible.   Just weeks after birth, lambs\' ears are punched, their tails are chopped off, and males are castrated without anesthetic.  According to Australian Law Reform Chairman, M.D. Kirby, Australian sheep suffer over 50 million operations a year that would constitute cruelty if performed on dogs or cats.(8) Extremely high rates of mortality are considered ""normal"": 20-40 percent of lambs die at birth or before the age of eight weeks from cold or starvation; eight million mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect. One million of these die within 30 days of shearing.(6)   In Australia, the most commonly raised sheep are Merinos, specifically bred to have wrinkly skin (which means more wool per animal). This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture. Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the hatched maggots can literally eat sheep alive. To prevent ""flystrike,"" Australian ranchers perform a barbarous operation--""mulesing""--or carving huge strips of skin off the backs of unanesthetized lambs\' legs. This is done to cause smooth, scarred skin that won\'t harbor fly eggs. Yet the bloody wounds often get flystrike before they heal; and despite the feeling by many that mulesing may kill more sheep than it saves, the mutilation continues.(10)      Aging sheep are subjected to ""tooth-grinding,"" an unanesthetized procedure that sheep farmers claim reduces tooth loss and extends the sheep\'s productive life. A battery-operated grinder is used to wear down the teeth. Another method involves using the edge of a disc cutter to cut right through the teeth near the level of the gums. This terrifying and painful procedure exposes the sensitive pulp cavities inside and causes the teeth to bleed profusely.(9)    Faced with such vast amounts of death and disease, the rational step would be to reduce the numbers of sheep so as to maintain the existing ones decently. Instead, sheep are forced to bear more lambs by the administration of drugs.  Malnourished ewes are taken into laboratories and placed in climate-controlled chambers to determine how much exposure they can withstand before they die.(7)   Like other ""commodities,"" animals can fall victim to fluctuations in the economy. In 1990, 10 million Australian sheep were shot and buried in mass graves when they became practically valueless due to a lingering drought and low wool prices.   Shear Torture   Sheep are sheared each spring, after lambing, just before they would naturally shed their winter coats. Timing is critical: shearing too late means loss of wool. In the rush, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year of exposure after premature shearing. A closely shorn sheep is, in fact, more sensitive to cold than a naked man since a sheep\'s normal body temperature is about 102 degrees F, much higher than a human\'s.(2)   When shearing, speed is everything. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by hour, which encourages working quickly and carelessly. Says one eyewitness: ""the shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals. I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or fists until the sheep\'s noses bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off.""   Live Export   When the sheep age and are no longer effective wool producers, they are transported long distances to slaughterhouses in trucks and trains without food or water. Those who fall are trampled by other frightened animals. On arrival, the dead and dying are piled into heaps. Those with foot rot attempt to drag themselves on their knees.(11)   The ultimate cruelty is the live export of seven million sheep every year from Australia to the Middle East, which the Wool Council of Australia supports as ""an important component of the wool and sheep industry."" These sheep travel vast distances until they reach the feedlots where they are held before being loaded onto ships. Many sheep, ill or wounded from the journey, faced with intensive crowding, disease, and strange food, die in the holding pens. Eighteen percent of sheep die during the 3-6 week transport process; in just one Australian feedlot, 15,000 sheep died from cold in 1983.(12)    The surviving sheep--7 million a year--are herded onto huge 14-tier-high ships resembling the old slave-trade ships. Up to 125,000 sheep are packed tightly into each ship, each allocated an area hardly bigger than themselves, so that not all can lie down at once, or reach the feed troughs. Mired in their own waste for three weeks or more, the sheep suffer from sea-sickness, temperature extremes, disease, and injuries. Younger animals or babies born en route are often trampled to death. Shipboard mortality ranges up to 10 percent, and for every sheep who dies, many others become ill and are injured.(13)   When the three-week trip to the Middle East is over, the surviving sheep are killed in ritual slaughter (Halal).  Since Moslem religious law does not require that the knife be sharpened between kills, sheep often have their throats sawed open with dull knives. According to one witness in the Sitra abbatoir in Bahrain, men would begin slaughtering as soon as a pen was full.  The sheep would ""wave their heads in obvious confusion, trying to stand up and call out as the blood gushed from their throats.""(14) Other sheep are loaded into the trunk of a car for later slaughtering at the buyer\'s home.   Wildlife ""Scapegoats""   Sheep aren\'t the only animals who suffer as a result of the wool industry. The Australian government permits the slaughter of approximately 5 million kangaroos a year because it views them as ""pests"" who eat grass ranchers want for their sheep and cows. Ninety percent of kangaroo killers are ""weekend"" hunters, killing by the most expedient methods available:  running kangaroos down in trucks, poisoning their water, beating them to death, even impaling them on stakes and meat hooks and skinning them alive. The standard kangaroo hunting technique, as recounted by Paul and Anne Erlich in their book  Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species , is to ""spotlight"" them from cars at night. ""The kangaroos would freeze in the light and were shot with rifles. Some were killed immediately, but some hunters purposely just wounded them--sometimes leaving them to suffer for hours or days so that their meat would remain fresh until they could be collected."" According to Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the U.S., joeys, or young kangaroos ""are not considered to be worth the cost of a bullet...and are often killed by being thrown against a tree or car bumper or kicked in the head.""   In the U.S., coyotes, vilified for allegedly preying on sheep and other livestock, are poisoned, shot and burned alive by the hundreds of thousands every year by ranchers and the U.S. government.   There are Alternatives   There are alternatives to wool clothes and blankets that the many people who are allergic to wool already use, including cotton, cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other man-made fibers. These wash easily, don\'t shrink, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don\'t contribute to cruelty.

The pair, who met when the  poles  of  their  portable  IV\'s  of   Maintainizine  collided  on  their  way   to   shock   treatment   therapy, apparently  were  left  to  their  own  comedic  devices  when  the  TV broke in the day room last week.   ""I\'ve listened to  the  CD  and  have  concluded  that  Frau  Lee and  Herr  Sea  are  too  sick  for  this  facility,""  said  Chief   of Psychiatry, Dr.  Sy Cotic.      ""I\'d   mistakenly  thought  there   was hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming to meals with their gowns open in  the  front,  but  when  they  didn\'t respond to occupational therapy  and  got  on  this  joke  jag,  I  had to let them go.       We  simply  cannot  tolerate   patients   wasting valuable materials to make hand  buzzers  and  fake  barf,""  Dr.  Cotic continued.   Although  unavailable  for  comment,  ""Lee  and  Sea   vehemently deny  having  made  the  CD  while  on  the  inside,""  an  unidentified spokesman said.     ""Actually,  one  day  they  were  so  bored,   they escaped,  unnoticed,  and  ended-up  at  a  nearby   grange   hall   in Chimacum,  Washington  where  they  happened  upon  a  bunch  of  other former patients who  were  attempting  to  improvise  eco-based  comedy bits for Seattle area  radio  station,  KSER.  Trying  to  turn  topics as grim as acid rain dripping through  holes  in  the  ozone  into knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right  away. When Sea\'s old Radio Shack dictation  machine  caught  fire,""  the spokesman continued, ""the other inmates fled.    But Lee  and  Sea stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which  became  the streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led  to  the  creation  of Mouthbreather.    With  no  hope  of  obtaining  corporate financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability  checks  and held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an  award  winning job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken  IV bottle at his throat.   The result  is  seventy-two  minutes  of incisive, synapse blistering humor.  Mouthbreather: Humor  for  the Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes . On  CD  and Cassette.

Fans of the legendary Firesign Theater will feel right at home in Mouthbreather country.""   - Bob Boardman, Reviewer for The Leader     ""Huh? I don\'t get it.  What\'s a Mouthbreather, anyway?""   - Fan of Gilligan\'s Island and Gomer Pyle re-runs     ""The entire CD is wonderful, but I especially liked the Mantra Matic Commercial section of The New Age Network.  It\'s hysterical.""   - Susan Stone, KPFA Radio, Berkeley     ""You guys oughta have yer mouths washed out with soap!""   - Anonymous, thin-lipped, not so innocent bystander     ""I finally got to hear  Mouthbreather  and I enjoyed it.

Penelope was heralded as the ""archetypal indomitable rock \'n\'  roll woman and her band dubbed ""a major national musical asset""  by  The New Touser Press Record Guide .   Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody,  and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness  of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and  immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the  dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello,  accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn,  melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in  terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of  the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.

"b'    Markay, Barbara      Markay, Barbara                 Change to Come                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:48 mins, 2.73M, 5.46M)          Folk ,   Rock ,   Pop ,   World Beat                                       In an age when popular musicians rely highly on sex, gimmickry and shameless hype to influence audiences and boost record sales,  Barbara Markay  is a standout talent with extraordinary musical abilities.   With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markay has worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging trom Quincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Her credits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson\'s ""BAD"" video, directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band through Leon Pendarvis - the band\'s keyboard player with whom she worked.   Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York\'s prestigious Juilliard School of Music where she studied composition with Roger Sessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despite her exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confined to that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms. Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the European community as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by a couple of Britain\'s better known producers. She met the challenge    by performing to standing ovations on many European campuses.  Upon arrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her own Miami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success with a dance music hit, ""It\'s Allrite,"" (released on WEA International in Holland). The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, and romped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 in Holland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by ""I Don\'t Wanna Be A Zombie,"" which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, and demonstrated beyond a doubt that ""It\'s Allrite"" was no musical fluke.   In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated her multi-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances, record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which she was in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked until moving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completed her latest album, ""Change To Come"" which she composed, arranged and produced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a number of musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array of background musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a number of well-respected music critics.            Album Song Listing :       CHANGE TO COME       WOMAN OF LIGHT       I AM THE RIVER       NOBODY       BOOGOOYAGA       BABY SUNSHINE       FALLEN ANGEL       STRANGE FORTUNE       MAN FROM THE STARS       WAKE UP AND LIVE       STILL NEED YOU     "" Boogooyaga "" (from the album ""Change To Come"") 3:48 min.  (a Caribbean word meaning lack of sophistication)  "" Change To Come ""  3:48 min.    DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC :   ""Change To Come"" is an exciting, eclectic combination  of songs which underscores the artist\'s spiritual and professional growth.  The 11 tunes featured on this album shows a sensitivity for and understanding of the  troubling  issues  which  threaten  to ravage our world--women\'s rights, the environment,  the human condition, intolerance, and the overriding need for universal love.  Markay has pulled  this  universality  of  themes together with an ingenious and exuberant intermingling  of musical  styles.  The  album  is  a triumph. Markay\'s fine-tuned musical acumen create  an album that is professionally well-crafted, stylish and musically superior.  The result is a commercially viable yet creatively exceptional gem that is destined  for success!    REVIEWS :     "" Women\'s rights, independence, unconditlonal love & guardian angels ... Markay has a true talent and this album is a shining showcase with her great radio-ready voice ... and top notch self-written pop songs--a winner!

As a collaborative group, they have written several  hundred songs.  While Black Rain\'s current play list consists of forty of  their strongest tunes, they are continually writing and performing new  material.   One of the band\'s most noted performances took place at the  California  Mid-State Fair  in August, 1993, where they opened up for the  Damn  Yankees , featuring  Ted Nugent  and  Tommy Shaw .  Other  major California venues have included  Dream Street  in San Diego;   Marquee  in Westminster and the  SLO Brew Company  in San Luis  Obispo.   Black Rain\'s high energy live performances and area radio play have  created an ever increasing consumer demand for their recorded music.   Regional Wherehouse record stores continually sell through  inventories  of the band\'s latest LP titled ""Black Rain"".  Black Rain\'s unique sound  has been described as Rock with a Blues tinge.   The band enjoys tremendous success in Central California and continues to  win new fans of all ages.  When not on stage, Black Rain can be found in  the studio recording their newest songs.

Cats    Pati  and her husband Pete have two cats,  Bogart   and  Frodo .  Bogart  is the troublemaker of the two.     Stan  and Natalie have two cats,  Mackey  and  Velcro  . Mackey\'s name derives from the Mac the Knife (he was named by Natalie\'s daughter when she was young), while Velcro is notable for his clinginess. Eventually we\'ll add an illustration of this... At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!     Dawn  has 3 happy  fur balls  named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie.  Tigers are wonderful things, Slinky thinks she\'s a spring, and Zipidie isn\'t so zippy now  that he\'s a whopping 18 pounds.  .   Dogs    Gordon\'s  roommate\'s dog,  Roque , is in charge of system security at  base.com .    Juno , the world\'s most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound,  chase cars with the grace of a penguin,  shatter glass with a single bark, and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick. If anyone dared enter his   master  \'s territory, they\'d be loved to death in seconds.     Goats    Ian \'s parents run a cashmere goat farm.  Here is a picture of   Lady , a doe imported from Australia, and two of her kids.  There are more goat pictures at the  Black Locust Farm  home page.    Pigs    Piggio  is a very happy pink pot pellied pig.  After a not terribly successful career as company mascot at 3DO, he hopes to change his name to Pignus and become Cygnus\' new garbage disposal, in spite of the more popular notion that the job might be  better served by a goat. He\'s had some very interesting adventures and has his very own   web page  to tell you all about it.    Birds   Cygnus\' animal preserve wouldn\'t be complete without a bird sanctuary, and in fact, you\'ll find one in  Dawn \'s house.   At last count, there were 7 feathered squawkers and 10 more cooking in the nest. And well, you know what they say about big birds, ""they make big poos"". Here are some of their pictures if you\'d like to meet some of them:    Cookie , the scary cookatoo,  Happy , the lonely cockatiel,  Cirrus and Tinsel , are two parakeets with half a brain each,  Yin , the lovebird who hates everyone,  Casper and Snowwhite , the albino cockatiels whose  eggs  won\'t hatch, and  Phoenix , the jeolous conure.    Fish    Stan  and Natalie also have a number of koi and goldfish in their outdoor pond.  In the summer, they like to come up to the surface and suck on your fingers. Perhaps someday we\'ll get a picture of the heron that has eaten several of our fish.  We usually keep a net over the pond to prevent any more such tragic events.    Everything Else    Herman  lives in a shell. He\'s very quiet, doesn\'t eat much, and doesn\'t get around too much. We often wonder if he\'s still alive.

Generally, one subscribes by sending an E-mail message to the  List Server  containing the following information in the message area:       subscribe LISTNAME your_first_name your_last_name       You then will get further instructions that tell you how to post messages to the  List Address , unsubscribe, find out who is on the list, and other capabilities.    Some of the lists archive their discussions and place them in public directories. If this is done (and we know about it), the message archives can be examined without necessarily signing up as a member.  This provides a means to look at the list\'s content and determine whether you are interested or not in becoming a member.

If a newsgroup is established you generally have to look at the postings, but you don\'t have to sign up to view the messages. However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server.

""If you make the wolves the  &gt; &gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs.""  There is little evidence to show that people with experience breaking into computer systems have any particular talent for protecting them.  A few may have some specific insights, and a rare few may have general background, but that is not the general case.  For instance, being able to guess someone\'s password doesn\'t mean someone is able to design a cryptographic algorithm to protect passwords; and being able to exploit a race condition doesn\'t mean one knows how to write effective code without them.  It\'s also the case that sheepdogs that ever stray and kill a lamb must themselves be put down.  Once they\'ve been a sheep killer, there is no way to ever trust them not to do it again -- the temptation might be too much for them on another occasion.  Ask a shepherd.  --spaf              Next message:   John Hawkinson: ""Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994""     Previous message:   Gene Spafford: ""Re: [8lgm]-Advisory-7.UNIX.passwd.11-May-1994""     In reply to:   Timothy Newsham: ""wolves and sheep on the inet""       Next in thread:   Steve Simmons: ""Re: wolves and sheep on the inet""   '",3

"b'    Adam Bomb                Stand On Up                           (Excerpt 120k, 180k / Full song 4:06 mins, 2.95M, 5.91M)          HipHop-Rap ,   College/Indie/Lo-Fi                                        Biography     Adam Bomb has lived behind ""enemy lines"" for most of his life, much to his dismay. As a white male, he watched his fellow Anglo-Americans create and perpetuate racist, prejudiced and sexist ideals. With his self-produced debut of ""Organic Hard-Core"" Rap he is out to unsettle the status quo and give them a dose, from one of ""their own"", of something that they have been deaf to for far too long... the TRUTH.                              Adam Bomb\'s rhymes defend individual freedom, attack authority and define true liberty which, to him, is more than just privileges for the advantaged few. His music throbs and grooves with funky samples, rock and funk inspired guitar tracks, keyboards, and live horns.    ""Government, religion, and social standing are not excuses for racism, sexism, oppression and censorship by the powers that be,"" Adam Bomb says. ""The Constitution was a great document, in theory, but its ideals have not been afforded, to this day, to all men and womyn equally. It has never been anything more than a fairy tale to many of the people who in large part built this country, but have to ask permission to share the dream.""   His tracks confront everything from racist attitudes of the powers that be, to sexism and the failing two-party political system. ""Stand On Up"", inspired by a Malcolm X speech warn all races that things haven\'t changed enough to relax on any level, and that action like that of the 60\'s Civil Rights movement is still a must:     \'Cause if you\'re sittin\' then you\'re just a sittin\' duck  Lettin\' those who choose, bombs instead of schools  Still vote for the sucker, if ya vote at all fool    In ""Peacemaker, Soulshaker"", Adam Bomb serves up other ideologies he disdains -- misogyny, organized religion, bigotry and violence among all races of people who should be fighting the system rather than smoking dope, drinking ""40\'s"" and killing each other.    ""The System"" calls for an end to the two-party system which as Adam Bomb sees it is a farce. ""Although the two groups make a lot of noise espousing different points of view, they are essentially the same. They have their own best interests in mind and the true needs of the masses are not even an issue"".     My vision  Destroy the institution  With an urge ta purge suckers that are usin\' up the masses  Mutha fuckin\' facists, I won\'t be passive  Better believe I\'m down for somethin\' drastic...  Enough of this evil  Politicians gonna keep ya in submission till ya feeble    ""Everybody Get-A-Gun"" takes a sarcastic swipe at those in our society who are obsessed with firearms.     Mother don\'t cry, he only thought he was protecting you  Not expecting to  Take out his own son, with a cap from his own gun  The same gatt we used ta shoot for fun...  The Second Amendment  Nothin\' more than a remnant of our past  The Second Amendment  Propaganda from a Klansmen in my path    By attacking long since established views, values and philosophies, Adam Bomb is prepared for criticism from middle America. He is also prepared for the Hip-Hop and Rap communities to come at him as well by virtue of the fact that his skin is white. ""I\'ve seen it happen, and quite frankly in many cases, people got what they deserved. I feel my music is different. My lyrics are relevant and I am not wasting people\'s time to fill my pockets. It\'s people\'s minds I hope to help set free"".   Realizing his passion for expressing himself through music at an early age, Adam Bomb formed a band with his brother when he was barely out of elementary school. He went from high school to study sound design at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It was during his college years that Adam Bomb discovered a powerful from of expression that spoke to him and the ideals that he believed in vehemently. He walked in to a record store one day and knew that in Rap he had found his niche. ""I heard Public Enemy in a local store, and their message and delivery inspired me to change my outlook on music"", Adam Bomb recalls. ""Chuck D\'s lyrics were intelligent, deep and pertinent."" Chuck D, KRS-1 and Ice Cube became his strongest Rap influences.   Adam Bomb\'s first project was producing a young rapper named Stud B. As Adam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracks for both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original. Songs like ""Earth to the White Man"" and ""Proof is in the Pudding"", which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of the pairs collaboration.   Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve as an artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative sounds and ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will force those ""in charge"" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish the power to those who should have had it all along.

I got your tape in the post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work. it really is great, \'organic hardcore\' just about describes it for me.  a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you? - one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE, I\'m thinking of \'megablast\' especially.

Shepherd:  Yeh.   Tourist:  Hmm, thought they were.   Only, what are they doing up in the trees?   Shepherd:  A fair question and one that in recent weeks 'as been much on my mind.    It's my   considered opinion that they're nestin'.   Tourist:  Nesting?   Shepherd:  Aye.   Tourist:  Like birds?   Shepherd:  Exactly.   It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the  misapprehension that   they're birds.   Observe their be'avior. Take for a start the  sheeps' tendency to 'op   about the field on their 'ind legs.   Now witness their attmpts  to fly from tree to   tree.   Notice that they do not so much fly as...plummet.        Tourist:  Yes, but why do they think they're birds?   Shepherd:  Another fair question.   One thing is for sure, the sheep is not a creature  of the air.    They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'.      Trouble is, sheep are very dim.    Once they get an idea in their 'eads, there's no   shiftin' it.   Tourist:  But where did they get the idea?   Shepherd:  From Harold.   He's that most dangerous of creatures, a clever sheep. 'e's  realized   that a sheep's life consists of standin' around for a few months and then bein'  eaten.    And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep.   Tourist:  Well why don't just remove Harold?   Shepherd:  Because of the enormous commercial possibilities if 'e succeeds.            """,3

This kind of presumtion is both foolish and  &gt; dangerous. The world is a complex place, and while making analogies offers &gt; a tool to simplify it, it also simplifies it. Too often these sorts of &gt; debates fall victim to sophmoric logical faults, most commonly those  &gt; associated with ambiguity &amp; equivocation. As well it seems the argumentative &gt; fallacies seem especialy prone to abuse, particularly Argumentum ad Hominem &amp; &gt; &amp; False Cause fallacies.  &gt;   lots of pretentious crap deleted  &gt; The world IS a complex place. False arguments on the net DO waste &gt; bandwith. &gt;  &gt; \t\t\tTim Scanlon &gt;    It\'s all very well proposing that we all give thoroughly rigorous arguments, but as you say, most of us do not have a classical education. Therefore I suggest you dont waste bandwidth with the dictionary that you swallowed, or waste our time having to read this verbose twaddle.

From this seamless blend of the traditional and  digital worlds,  Reingold  creates a hauntingly familiar  sound, that gently stretches the boundaries from the classical  realm to the New Age.     \t Al Reingold  uses these unique melodic lines to frame  his debut,   ""Stranger Looking In""  , which   Reingold  released on his own label,  SLI Records,  Ltd .  This vast undertaking was completely arranged and  produced by the artist himself, and ranges from rock-n-roll, to  jazz, to blues, to classical and to the New Age.  He recorded  each piece with different guest musicians, including some of  Atlanta\'s finest players.  In addition to crafting the music  and lyrics,  Al Reingold  plays piano, synthesizers,  acoustic guitar, mandolin and percussion.

All instruments and vocals performed, produced, and composed by Pattrex. Copyright 1995 Pattrex.  Email at ""pattrex@npixi.com"".    Pattrex performs with a 4 piece backing band occasionally. They are loud (like a jet taking off at a distance of 10 feet), so bring ear protection when you see them. Yes, Pattrex is a vegetarian but that doesn\'t mean he is a ""nice mellow kind of guy"". Hemorrhaging at concerts is not a fun thing. Protect your ears. Always.    The idea behind Pattrex is to create exciting experiences utilizing available technology. Pattrex is part of an emerging convergence of these tools. The song you\'ll be listening to is a midtempo type pop thing.  Kinda sounds like a cross between Smashing Pumpkins and Peter Gabriel. And then some.  The music is real. If you like what you hear and want to hear more please send check or money order of $9.00 plus $2.00 shipping and handling to:        Empty Street Productions    931 Monroe Drive STE 102-183  Atlanta, GA 30308      For a 4 song cassette tape and some propaganda mailings. If you ask, we\'ll even enclose a Macintosh Floppy Disk Demo (requires a color capable Mac and at least a 13"" screen).

Here\'s a popular one:  http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html      You will soon be able to electronically order a Pattrex CD EP over various BBS\'s. This will really expedite things, \'cause you\'ll be able to use your credit card and get the CD mailed to you overnight. Wow. Again, send email if you are interested in that. This should be up and running by May 1995     Most of what you are hearing was created and recorded digitally. The studio this was recorded in is a tiny back room at Empty Street in Atlanta, GA. Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a 1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode\'s StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder. Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software for this effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. I recommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, a basic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additional tracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually.  The only semi-expensive element was an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studios in Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217) 367-3530). Oh, yeah- a cool 12 string electric guitar was borrowed from CV LLoyde\'s in Champaign (call (217) 352-7031 to harass Gary and CV and order stuff).    But that\'s not all...   Pattrex has several multimedia demos available on-line through the internet and on services such as America Online and Compuserve. One of these, the first Macintosh-created music industry promo clip available on the Internet, is called ""pats music video"" and is available via anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu under directory /info-mac/grf/qt. Pattrex also has appeared on the Internet ""musenet"" 1992 compilation CD with the song ""There\'s Love Here Today"", and on the 10th AMUG CDROM compilation BBS-In-A-Box (available through the Arizona Macintosh Users Group). Pattrex is a founding member of the renegade multimedia group ""NPiX InterActive"", and creates freelance multimedia for the entertainment industry in his spare time.     Pattrex is a member of IICS (International Interactive Computing Society), ASCAP, and an Apple Associate Developer and MultiMedia Program member. Pattrex is also part of  NPiX Interactive .    You *might* be able to reach Pattrex at (404) US-FOLKS. Maybe. That machine is pretty flaky, though. Email is best. Or voice mail us at (404) 892-1971.    Critics say:   ""Hot, Hot, Hot. It sure is f*cking hot out today, why the hell don\'t you get air conditioning huh?""         - Gary Strater of the band StarCastle  formerly on Epic Records (check out StarCastle\'s upcoming album!)

"b'     Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford            Center Description   The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the  Stanford University School of Medicine , and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on  informatics  issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the  National Library of Medicine (NLM)  to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from  NIH (the National Institutes of Health)  or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is  Stanford -based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the  Medical School Office Building (MSOB)  on the  Stanford University campus .        General Information   \t Includes answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Please read this before sending email to the maintainers of this web.

"b'     Black Sheep Writing Contest Invitation         Invitation and Announcement     Black Sheep Writing Contest  Sponsored by the  Colorado Genealogical Society .     The Colorado Genealogical Society invites you to compete for its Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence. Our purpose is to provide an opportunity for you to apply your writing and documenting skills to ""black sheep"" genealogical subject matter. We seek originality in choice, treatment, and presentation of subject matter as well as the achievement of excellence in writing and documentation.      Your choice of subject is important. Black Sheep is defined as ""a person considered undesirable or disgraceful by his family or group."" Your subject need not be related to your family. All subjects in your paper must have died prior to 1930. Here are some examples of topics: genealogy of the ownership of a bordello which made your city/family/state notorious; a wild and woolly ancestor of yours, of a friend, or of no one you know; an unusual past owner of the house you live in; an introduction to a compilation of the infamous such as to an index of markers in a ""boot hill cemetery"" or a jail (the compilation need not be a part of the entry); a religious heretic, or a devout Christian in a family of heretics.      Entries will be judged on such criteria as: originality in choice and treatment of subject matter; writing style (technique and approach in presenting subject); depth of research; evaluation of evidence; quality of source material used to document evidence; and writing mechanics (form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, documentation).      The Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence will be presented for overall superior quality in written presentation. In addition, citations for excellence may be awarded for special recognition of originality, writing style, documentation, or technique.     Judges for the 1996 Contest       Guest Judge,  Helen F.

Fused with playful structural psychadelics, this combination results in an explosive burst of pop that\'s been turned  upside down, melded with darkness, and produces an intoxicating brew of melodic  whimsy. Coat pushes the limits of noise!   With their boy-girl-boy-girl line up, Coat can come off as gratifyingly raw or  gleamingly pop. Yet this L.A. based quartet has a limitless capacity for drawing one in with  achy guitar melodies. Their hyper-hypnotic rhythms combined with oddly accessible pop  hooks, create a natural flowing buoyancy.

The spoken word lyrics are  somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated  elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the  verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem  would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able  to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to  remember a song's melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have  been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today.  KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from  the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works.

"b'     Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham         Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham    From  The News , Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.    Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.    Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.   It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police to limit police escorts for exporters.   As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from  Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton.   The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the lorry to test the resolve of the police.   ITF\'s director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue.   A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit.   A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said the load was bound for Shoreham.   He said in Cheltenham ""I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries  which is roadworthy and fully insured has been stopped on the Queen\'s  highway for whatever reason.""   Demonstrators at the port hailed the latest incident in the four-month  battle to halt animal shipments to France as a triumph.   One said: ""We are absolutely delighted. I have never believed the police  were in favour of this kind of thing.""   Sussex Chief Constable Paul Whitehouse announced recently that his officers would only provide escorts for exporters delivering to Shoreham for two days each week.

Dairy Goats  are raised for goat milk.  They  also make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.     Pygmy Goats  are raised primarily for show.  Like  dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.      Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because  they are easier to manage, they don\'t have an offensive odor (unlike bucks),  and there are more shows for does.  A male goat that has been neutered is known as a  wether.  We usually don\'t keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy  wethers.  Other domesticated goats include  Boer goats  that are starting to be raised for meat,  Cashmere goats  that are raised for cashmere and  Nigerian Dwarf goats .  Domesticated goats differ from wild goats such as  Mountain goats .

Goats are very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good scratch.  Most goats\' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes.  It is very rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have kids and grandkids of her own.  With goats that doesn\'t have too take too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to breed when they are just a year old.  It\'s also neat to learn how to milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn\'t ordinarily be able to do.         Goat Statistics       Body Temperature:  102.5&#176 F-104&#176 F    Pulse/heart rate:  60 to 80 beats per minute   Respiration rate:  15 to 30 breaths per minute   Puberty:  4 to 12 months   Estrus (""heat"") cycle:  18 to 23 days   Length of each ""heat"":  12 to 36 hours   Gestation (length of pregnancy):    150 days     Breeding season:   Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year.  Dairy goats  usually go into heat between August and January in the Northern Hemisphere.   Weight: An adult pygmy goat weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. An adult dairy goat  doe weighs between 125 and 200 pounds. An adult dairy goat buck weighs between 200  and 300 pounds.           A healthy goat     Eyes clear and bright.   Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection.  Coat smooth and shiny.   A dull coat could indicate parasites.  Fluffed up coat means  the goat is not feeling well.  Appetite good.   However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat.  Attitude alert.   Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.             Basic care   Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without  water.  We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a bucket of water.  In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the water doesn\'t freeze, but we don\'t have that problem.   Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a  day and still have perfectly healthy goats.  You will have to decide what is practical for  your animal and your schedule.   Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be  soiled by the goat.    The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult  dairy goat doe eats about  1/2 flake a day  (about 5 pounds).  This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein depending on the additional needs of the goat:     Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds   Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds   Dry doe:  0-1 pounds   Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds   Wethers: Usually given no grain.    We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper calcium-to-phosphorous ratio.    Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your area.         Preventative health care    In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia. We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent ""white muscle disease"" in kids.  Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of body weight twice a year.  The best time for bred does to receive BoSe is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid. Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc), unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given. It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at 21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow. Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations.  When using the combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod vaccine.     Check with a local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of injectible you use.  Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal.  In your area, additional vaccines for other diseases may be necessary.      We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in the spring immediately following kidding.  We use TBZ or paste wormers intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate (Strongid C).  Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat.  Check labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.             Common  Diseases     Coccidia  are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat.  Sometimes a goat with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft stool or no obvious symptoms at all.  You might not suspect a problem until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they should.  Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and should be treated at least once with the medication Albon.  Our veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.       Ketosis  (also known  as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The  doe  may be depressed,  weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.    If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early  in  the  disease, many does will show a positive test for  ketone bodies in the urine.    Ketosis may occur  when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when  the doe is very fat.  This disease is caused by the  sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing  kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat  to eat enough  of her normal diet to provide  this energy  (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will  rapidly  metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic  by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at  two to three ounces  twice a day will help.  If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful  unless she delivers at that time.     As a preventive measure,  do not let the doe  get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month  of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay.            Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome   (CAE) is a viral disease.  In young kids  symptoms include  a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite,  However,   the unused  legs  lose  muscle  strength  and  structure and the infected kids eventually die.   In older goats, the same disease is seen as  swollen joints, particularly the knees.   The disease develops slowly, and  after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using  its legs properly.   Infected goats have no fever,  remain alert, and eat well.  However, they do not  recover from the arthritis.   An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE.  The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by  contact or  through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective  procedures or treatments.  Isolating kids at birth and raising them on  pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It\'s a good idea  to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test only checks for antibodies, and it\'s possible that an animal is infected and not (yet) producing antibodies.     Mastitis   is  an  inflammation  of  the mammary  gland  (udder  or  milk-giving  gland)  of  animals,  usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms  of mastitis are heat,  pain,  and swelling of  the  udder.  Usually you will notice some discoloration of  the tissue and abnormal milk.   The infected udder  will change in color from slightly more pink to a  bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an  infected udder will vary in color,  texture,  and  thickness.   The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is  a good test for  subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate.  Laboratory culture or  growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine  the exact diagnosis.      The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment  and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat\'s udder  before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking  with a teat dip.  Wash your hands before milking each goat  to prevent the spread.  The treatment  consists  of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes  accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet  is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria  that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each.  If untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.           Breeding   A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months old the first time she is bred.  A pygmy goat should be between 9 and 18 months and a good size for her age.  In order for the doe to conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus (""heat"" or ""season"".)  Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail), mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited behavior if she is near a buck.  At first, you\'ll probably breed your does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to consider  owning your own buck or artificial insemination .  A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding season.          Labor    The  expected due date   is 150 days after breeding.  A few weeks before delivery, the goat\'s udder will usually become enlarged.  A day or two before birth, the udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two.  The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of mucous.  In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before birth.    In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac which is surrounded by a water sac.  Usually the water sac bursts 30 minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid.  The amniotic sac might burst a few minutes before delivery.  Usually, a kid will be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later.          If the kids haven\'t arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks, or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by repositioning the kid or ""pulling"" the kid out.         Care of newborn goats    Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and nose are free of mucous.  It is not necessary to cut the umbilical cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of the kid, we tie it with dental floss.  Within an hour of birth, we dip the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.   Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse. It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.   Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned.  Before dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns) and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod is repeated yearly.             Cost of raising a goat   Here are the approximate costs of items needed for raising a goat:      Purchase price: Expect to pay between $100 and $300 for a registered Dairy Goat kid and between $150 and $350 for a Pygmy Goat.    Feed: The cost of alfalfa hay in Southern California varies between $9 and $12 per bale, depending on the season and the feed store.  Grain costs about $9 per 50 pound bag.

Steve,  Dave, Kerry and Jack formed the band as an oasis from the hair metal bands of the late 80\'s early 90\'s. Tailspin Magazine described their sound as ""twisted punk with a sense of humor"".  Drawing from 80\'s bands as the Pixies, the Plimsouls and the Ramones as influences,  the Elvis Diet  has formed their own left of center punk sound.  the Elvis Diet  pushes their live shows to extremes, similar to the kings eating binges, very extreme.  They frequently can be seen in the Chicagoland area, either in the city or the suburbs providing an energy filled show. To their credit they have two CD\'s available for sale. The Debut CD contains the song\'l Wanna be a Kennedy\', this song is a humorous bash of the Kennedy clan and was featured on over 50 college radio stations throughout the US. The sound clip song Question Everything and Ground Hog is from the just released second CD entitled Gravity Furnace.  the Elvis Diet  has a mailing list that keeps fellow dieters updated on upco@ng shows and current Elvis sightings. All interested are invited to come join the crowd. You may contact the band by mail at  the Elvis Diet , P.O.

The fast guitar and techno schizophrenia of ""x/l/r flood o.d."" then collapses into the mystical wanderings of ""ignatio chloride the balding."" ""the revolutionary om"" uses ambient soundscapes to slowly build into an explosive ending. The grinding guitars and scraping metal percussion of ""idiot\'s planet"" lead into the hallucinogenic crawl of ""tsunami fungus."" ""excruciate"" combines a thumping subsonic kick with extensive guitar work, while the sinuous bass and drum sounds of ""string (premonition v)"" blend together for a more Eastern flavor. ""afraid"" winds through tribal rhythms and crunchy guitars featuring a strange vocal melody which by the end sets the mood for ""near."" ""zoviet-amerikka"" closes the CD with a hip-hop and funk rampage that fades into a classical ode to the decay of the U.S.A.    ""nada is the product of years of frustrated attempts to create a distinctive band in the San Jose Area,"" said Robert M. Riddle IV. After playing with  Autumn Cathedral , Riddle formed  Swivelfaust  and  Slur  before the decision to start nada as a solo project. Riddle enlisted the talents of other musicians, including Scott Martinez (Autumn Cathedral), Damien Gonzalez (Swivelfaust, Slur) and Mason Jones (Trance).  The album was recorded at House of Faith in Palo Alto by Bart Thurber and produced by nada and Mason Jones. ""This is the most satisfying mix of electronic, experimental, psychedelic and rock music that I have been able to create so far.""    Nada uses influences as diverse as tribal drumming, techno sampling, hip-hop rhythms, wailing guitar and experimental noise to come up with a rich audio tapestry that is reminiscent of music by  Coil ,  The Legendary Pink Dots  and  Savage Republic  that should appeal most listening tastes.

They had neither guns nor  horses and lived a stone-age lifestyle, hunting the Rocky Mountain Bighorn  sheep for food and clothing.  Modern Archeology and Anthropology along with  first-hand accounts of trappers and explorers help to tell the story of The  Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past.  \t This is a video for people of all ages that reveals the story of  prehistoric Indians living in Yellowstone before it became the world's first  National Park.

If you have information about other disorders, you can also send that, but it must be pre-formatted (in HTML) and ready to go.      A great resource for information about other sleep disorders is   Dr. Michael Thorpy\'s home  page , which contains links to sleep-related resources of all kinds.    Hey!   read my resume!

I don\'t like to define my style because I have always felt that was someone else\'s job. I like to write about things I feel passionate about and communicate my feelings through songwriting. I think my music is unique because although I\'d like a career in music, that is not my motivation. Making music is very spiritual and songs are like prayers for me. My songs are always analytical, sometimes topical and occasionally political because I want the listeners to get emotional about, think about or get angry about a subject they were previously unfamiliar with. I think a good song can get under your skin and bring up emotions you never knew were there.        Band member list:       Although I\'m a solo artist, I\'ve had the privilege of working with very talented musicians:   Automo Joe  (Tribute to Jimi Hendrix)  : written and produced by Dorothy Wallace     John Petrucci  -  Guitar:  When my original guitar player cancelled an hour before this session, I called Focus II Guitar Center in Commack, Long Island to see if they knew a guitar player who was a Hendrix fan, so they sent me one of their teachers, John Petrucci. Now he\'s doing real well with his progressive Metal band ""Dream Theater"" (East West Records). Their latest album ""Awake"" blows Megadeth right out the window! One guitar magazine called him the ""Guitar Hero of the Nineties""!. Lucky Me! He played on my song!!     Dave Ambrosio  -  Bass:  A very talented virtuoso musician. Dave has a degree in composition from Manhattan School of Music and is playing with a Jazz band in Manhattan. He can also play keyboards and has played guitar on some of my songwriting demos.     Paul Presseau  -  Drums:  Another virtuoso musician. He can also play piano and guitar and writes beautiful lyrics. He likes to travel and study music of different cultures.

The idea was to make my voice not only sing the lyrics but also sound like a guitar. Then for the guitar to tell the rest of the story when I stopped singing the lyrics. I\'m very proud of this production because it\'s the first record I produced that sounds exactly the way I wanted it to sound. I also incorporated elements of ""Hey Joe"" and other Hendrix riffs into this song.    America:    I wanted this to sound like it\'s coming from the point of view of a Native American which is why I used tribal drum sounds. This is combined with military marching band sounds because the song is about how greed, power and the desire for world domination can destroy a beautiful country. The intro and outro are excerpts of Gospel singer Marion Williams\' ""They Lead my Lord Away"".

Since hls early teens, Josh has had a dream to conquer  the realms of musicology.  From  writirig  song  lyrics,  to composing music to fit them to, Josh was never told he   couldn\'t  do  it.  In  his  twenty-one  years  he  has reveled to the heights of his dream, mastering the art  of playing several musical instruments, writing  heart rendering lyrics, and arranging  music  that  wlll  set   the  hardest  soul  to  dancing.  To  make  the  cycle complete, Josh has delved into the other side of the  board and  become  a  prolific  producer  as  well.  With two completed albums, \'Lifetimes\' (Rock alternative)  with his \'Nowhere Dreamer\' band,  and  as  a  Soloist  on the  album  \'Venus  Butterfly\' -\'Tao  of  lust\',  (Techno   Dance,)  Josh  Mottley,  and  long  time  friend  Doug Robertson have brought Adult Comedy Rap to the list of  his ever growing  repertoire  of  original  productions wlth their newest endeavor, \' NASTY WABBIT .\' Although the   finishing  touches  have  yet  to  be  put  on  this humorous demo, the two have gotten off to a great start  wlth \'Naked Naked\' and \'Fire In The Hole.\'   Doug Robertsom affectionately known as \'The Party  Animal\'   by  Josh  and  their  friends,  was  born and raised In Grand Rapids,  Michigan  on  January  the   8th.  1971.

Mottley, by now an old pro to the music industry, took \'Rappin\'  Doug\'  Into  the  studio  to  produce his first encounter into the music field. Doug took to the  microphone like a duck takes to water.  Before  all the scratch vocals were laid for the  music,  Doug  could   be  heard  through  the  speakers  calling  to  the engineer, \'Hey Rog, roll the damn tape.\'   Doug has completed the first two songs  on  the  demo   under  the  dlrection  of  Mottley  who  wrote and arranged the music and also sang the back ground  parts of the songs,  \'Naked  Naked\'  and  \'Fire  In  The Hole;\' both of which were lyrically written by Robertson.  When ask where  he  gets  hls  rapping  talent  Doug kindly replies, \'I\'m a black man living in a white mans body.\'            While waiting to complete the \'Nasty Wabbit\' album, Doug  can be  found  working  as  a  waiter  in  a local Scottsdale restaurant.  When  not  working  or   rappin\',  Doug  attends  Scottsdale  Community  College, where he is majoring in Business Administration.

ISIKOJAM was formed while Kirk Casey, Soul Maah, and Maanas Itene were backing various South African and reggae artists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Kirk brought keyboardist Jonathan Ridpath to the group, and after one night of playing that was it! ""It felt as though we had been playing together for years.""   ISIKOJAM combines many styles of music and fuses them together to produce music that is very groove oriented with distinct melodies.     BASS:   Simon (Soul) Maah from Cameroon played with EKAMBI Brilliant and Manu Dibango,  The Soul Makossa Man. Soul left Cameroon for Nigeria to play with  Jerry Cooper. He then embarked on a thirteen year recording and  producing career that took him to such world class studios as EMI,  DECCA, Phonodisk, RecordDisk, Satellite, and TABANSI. After touring  with Sonny Okusons for five years, Soul came to the United States  looking for new challenges.  Residing in the East Bay, Soul plays for  many international and local artists that make their way through the  Bay Area.     GUITARS:  Kirk Casey was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a young teenager his band  opened shows for The Grateful Dead, Santana, and The Sons Of Champlin.  Studying composition in college, Kirk then continued with Cuban  Classical guitar. Kirk\'s interest in world music and jazz lead him to  study music from many countries of the world. He then studied with  Miles Davis guitarist Dave Cramer. Currently, Kirk can be heard on  many national television commercials for such Fortune 500 companies as  Alamo Car rental, Toyota, GMC trucks, Buick,Yamaha motorcycles, and  the NBA. Kirk also tours internationally with Jamaican artists Della  Grant and The Twinkle Brothers.     DRUMS:  Maanas Itene hails from Nigeria, West Africa. It took Maanas three years to get to the United  States to seek his fortune as a respected musician. Upon arrival to  the United States the tour previously scheduled for the band was  canceled. Maanas found himself without work and stranded. He made his  way to the Bay Area, and now tours with KOTOJA, West African High Life  Band, and Inka Inka. Groups that Maanas has formerly played with in  Nigeria include Liberty Loverboy, Victor Suuku, Isaac Black, King  Walla Man, and Mandators.     KEYBOARDS:   Jonathan Ridpath has been playing for over thirty years. He studied at the Berklee School of  Music and the New England Conservatory. After his schooling, Jonathan  then toured along the East Coast, and has played at Tanglewood on  several occasions. Jonathan moved to San Francisco in 1976 and began  teaching classical piano.

"b'    Griffin, June      Griffin, June                 America\'s Sonata                           (Excerpt 120k, 120k / Full song 5 mins, 3.64M, 4.86M)          Folk ,   Experimental                               A letter from June:    I have been writing music since 1984 -- the year the ""end of the world""  was predicted and found it to be rather a good beginning.  I give God all  the glory for my inspiration and I am sure there are many that claim  inspiration, but the Book of James says that every good and perfect gift  comes from the Father, and what perfection there is in my music is a gift  from the God of the United States.  It usually takes me between 10 and 20  minutes to write a song, usually less, and I rarely have corrections to  make, only minor ones, a conjunction or the like.  I am 55 this July,  should the Lord let me continue to live, and am co-owner in a dental  laboratory with my husband.  I have run for office three times, holding  up the principes of free enterprise which made this nation great and  which will explain my concern for a real market, I am founder of a  publishing company and missionary society, again in conjunction with my  wonderful husband and am an ordained minister of the gospel.  I have a  daughter and a son, two step-daughters and beloved grandchildren.  I have  dedicated my life to rebuilding America with a special dedication and  burden of bringing glory to my forefathers of God\'s music.  I have  written over 200 songs and poems, but find that the stronghold of  merchandising control makes it nearly impossible to promote any music  beyond what is according to someone\'s preplanned agenda.  The old saying  says, ""Let me write the music of the nation, and I care not who writes  the laws.""  I will continue to write and trust God to punish thieves and  make them pay back fourfold, in this life, as well as in eternity.   \t\t\t\t Sincerely - for Christ,    \t\t\t\t June Griffin                         '",0
"b""   The Goat Shrine       The Goat Shrine   This page is fondly dedicated to Heidi Geshel, who knows the joys of  living in a goat-infested room and who also gave me the wit and  inspiration to do this page!           GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!  GOATS!   GOATS!  GOATS!      Why are Goats so Cool?  Oh, c'mon, just look at them.  They're amazing.  Not only are they cute,  but what other animal are you going to find that both eats your garbage   and  can make its own milk?  Exactly.  Besides, goats are just cool  by nature.  They make great sources of consolation in times of grief,  plus there are many unconfirmed rumors that they also make good sex  counselors too.      The Beard:  An Evolutionary Link  Truly, Darwin was on to something.  Think about it.  Goats have beards.   People have beards.  Hmm...could it be we that we and goats have a closer  family bond than we'd previously believed?  And if so, why, goats may be  on par with monkeys, dolphins, and white mice in intelligence.  Why, this  practically makes goats family to us!     Fear from the Masses  Yes, that's right, most people just can't handle the power that  goats represent.  That's why our society is trying to put them down and  repress the danger that goats hold for the weak-willed's stagnant and  close-minded ways of life.  Goats offer us freedom--a new and enlightened  way of life that will help us transcend the mundaneness of the everyday  world and take us to the ultimate level of perfection that we possess within  ourselves.  So don't be decieved by claims that goats are only good for  milk and cheese or angora and cashmere.  Realize that those beliefs are  only the last-chance efforts of a desperate group of people trying to  pose as a stumbling block to the new order.   Only by knowing the truth  can you become free.        How Did I Become Hooked?  Well, I really don't know.  This hobby/interest/obssesion of mine has  been going on for a few number of years now, but I can't quite pinpoint  how it started.  Mostly I think I saw some goats at a fair and was struck  by how cute they can be.  Plus, liking goats isn't quite the same as  liking dolphins or puppies, so the attention/amusement factor I get from  this is worth it.  Besides, the quest for finding goat &quotthings&quot  isn't easy, so it makes for a fun time.  However, the love of goats is a   double-edged sword which isn't always easy to wield.  One example was  when I took my niece (who was 3 years old back then) to a petting zoo  which had goats who were  intent on mobbing her and eating her clothing.  I &quotrescued&quot  her, and she's recovered quite nicely  since then (thanks to many readings of &quotThe Three Billy Goats  Gruff,&quot)  but the whole incidence just shows that  goats have a dark side   that can be unleashed if their power isn't properly reckoned  with.       My Goats  For those of you that care (and heck, I'm impressed if anyone's actually  read this far!), I have my own collection of goats.  Ok, they're not real  live goats, but I think terming them as merely inanimate is harsh, as  these goats definitely have a personality and prescence all their own.   Here they are, in the order I obtained them...     Inspector Gadget's Goat :  Yeah, I realize it's a pathetic  name, but it's the closest he's got.  He's just a small, brown plastic  goat and he has an equally small plastic Inspector Gadget figurine riding  him, hence the name.   The Straw Goat :  Another lack-luster name, but again, very  descriptive.  The Straw Goat is a self-standing goat made out of straw  who is no more than a foot high.  He was given to me by my friend  Anjanette, who obtained him from a store in Florida that bears his name.   Kimball :  Kimball is the &quotflag-goat&quot of my  collection.  He's a small stuffed white goat (whose picture can be seen  in various parts of my home page) who was given to me by my friend  Stacy.  Kimball's been a constant companion and has even survived a trip  to Hell (Michigan) and back.   Kelsey :  Kelsey is a small porcelin ornament of a brown goat  with a carrot in his mouth.  I got Kelsey for Christmas from John  Wallace, who was my Secret-Santa at the time.  Right now, Kelsey is  perched on my desk guarding my book collection.   Kalliope :  Ok, there's some discrepency that Kalliope might  actually be a llama, but we're not really sure.  She's a small (tiny,  even) stuffed red goat with neat designs on her.  David got her for me in  the Carribbean, which by the way, is a virtual haven for free-running goats.   Kassidy :  Kassidy is practically Kimball's twin.  The only  difference between them is the color of ribbon they wear around their necks  and the shade of brown that their horns are.  Kassidy was a gift from  John and Heidi, and she has seen me through many troubled times.   Gadriel :  Gadriel is the newest addition.  He's a  very   big goat with gray fur and vivid blue eyes.  He was purchased at the Ann  Arbor Street Art Fair for me by David, and due to Gadriel's size, hugging  him is almost like hugging a real goat.  Of course, I've never actually  hugged a real goat, and I'm guessing that hugging Gadriel is probably a  more enjoyable experience.          More Goat Sources...   Yes, they do actually exist, and here are the ones that I recommend:    The Irvine  Mesa Charros 4-H Club's Goat Page --This is a great source for real  goat info and facts, complete with tons of pictures, sounds, and diagrams.  These are some really good goat pictures that I could never get to save  for my page.  Check them out  here  and  here.    Back to  Richelle's Homepage   Last Updated:  July 30, 1995 """,2
"b'     Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats         Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats There are many versions of how coffee came to be but by far the most famous is that of Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats.  ""Once upon a time in the land of Arabia Felix, there lived a goatherd named Kaldi.  Kaldi was a sober responsible goatherd whose goats were also sober, if not responsible.  One night, Kaldi\'s goats didn\'t come home, and in the morning he found them dancing with abandoned glee near a shiny, dark-leafed shrub with red berries.  Kaldi soon determined that it was the red berries on the shiny, dark-leafed shrub that caused the goats\' eccentric behavior, and it wasn\'t long before he was dancing too. Finally, a learned imam from a local monastery came by, sleppily, no doubt, on his way to prayer.  He saw the goats dancing, Kaldi dancing, and the shiny, dark-leafed shrub with the red berries.  Being of a more systematic turn of mind that the goats or Kaldi, the learned imam subjected the red berries to various experimental examinations, one of which involved parching and boiling.  Soon neither the imam nor his fellows fell asleep at prayers, and the use of coffee spread from monastery to monastery, throughout Arabia Felix, and from there to the rest of the world.""

"b' HospitalWeb              Welcome to  HospitalWeb , a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.   This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing  potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a  simple  and  globally accessible way for  patients ,  medical researchers , and  physicians  to get information on any hospital  in the world is the goal.      This list is of ""main"" webservers (only  webservers  at  hospitals  will be  listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online  (due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without  ""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will  include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of  a hospital webserver, please  send me mail  and I will add it immediately!   This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital  that doesn\'t have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).    Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List!  I\'ve just set up a  listserv  for HospitalWeb.  Topics will be anything to do with  hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion  forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of  hospitals and the Internet.

We are  ""The Angels of Venice,""  a trio of professional female musicians performing original music for harp, flute and cello in the romantic/neoclassical style.  Dressed completely in white, we have been told our appearance is as striking as the beauty and feeling our music imparts to our listeners.   We specialize in creating an enchanting atmosphere for special occasions, from small private parties to weddings to large media and world events, of which we have extensive experience.   We have had the collective experience of playing in symphonies and doing session work for movie studios, to performing at the World Cup-sponsored ""Three Tenors"" concert at Dodger Stadium. We were just recently invited to play at The Screen Actors Guild Awards Ceremony Dinner. Our cellist participated in Yanni\'s ""World Tour 1995"" performing in countries around the world. Members of our prior audiences include Tom Hanks, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Ann-Margaret, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Guns \'N Roses, and many others.   Our music evokes happiness and pure joy as well as introspection, self-reflection and contemplation of one\'s inner spiritual world. Our credo is:      ""The Angels of Venice are Dedicated to Expressing Through Music the  Beauty and Mystery of the Human Spirit and Celebrating the Gift of  Life.""          Our current release is entitled ""The Angels of Venice - Music for Harp, Flute and Cello"" and we have manufactured CDs and cassettes of this title. To date we have sold on our own over 5,000 recordings of this original music. We sell directly to customers and through mail order and our music has been circulated from Los Angeles to Russia. We currently have distribution agreements with several well-respected companies.   We are writing to announce our availability to you for performances. We can be contacted at the telephone number listed at the top of this page. The  Angels of Venice  thank you in advance for your consideration.

Gregory and Rebecca have been performing with various bands in  the Bay Area and writing songs together for the past five  years. With the addition of Norman, formerly of the Paul  Godfrey Band, the band has attained the sound they\'ve been  looking for.              T he  music is ""introsective"" and is characterized by the unique  ""angelic vocal style"" os Rebecca. Compared by many to Annie  Lennox, The pretenders, Pink Floyd, and Kate Bush,  "" Rebecca\'s Mask\'s  influences are as eclectic as their  music,""according to  City Revolt  writer Aaron Johnston.       R ebecca\'s Mask  has been performing for enthusiatic crowds all  over the Bay Area, including San Francisco, San Jose, Santa  Cruz, Mt. View, and Campbell. Described as ""one of the South  Bay\'s best"" by KSCU\'s Subzero, the variety of the venues played  is testimony to the eclectic and versatile nature of the band.  Recent performances include the  Cactus Club  (San Jose),   Live Soup  (Santa Cruz),  Bay Area Coffee Roasting  Co.  (Mt. View), and  the Campbell Arts and Wine  Festival .       T he  band has recently developed an acoustic show, with help  from guitarist Kevin Mendoza, and has been in the studio  recording several of its latest songs.        R ebecca\'s Mask   is working toward landing a major record  deal in 1994 to produce a CD so that a wider audience can be  exposed to their music.                         '",0

"b""   Animals I Have Known      A pictorial tour of some of the animals   (and people) in my life   These are the first scans of these images.  Soon, I'll be coming back to  clean them up and make them a bit smaller so that all the poor people like me who only have SLIP connections don't have to spend so long waiting for the pictures come in.      I know it's just a boring, cliche`, dog picture to the rest of you but to my brother and I, this dog had so much character I had to put him in.  Sadly, Kodiak is no longer with us.      In this picture, we see my first dog, Patches, being very patient with my younger brother, Jason.  Jason is the one on the right and yes, that is a banana peel on the dog's head.      This is a goat we met in Amsterdam.  No other goats to be found. No other animals of any kind.  We weren't on a farm; in fact, we  were just on our way to a tulip nursery.  Apparently, goats just roam free on the outskirts of Amsterdam.  Who says travel isn't broadening?      Of course every university seems to have animals or statues of some sort that yell/roar/ring/etc. when freshmen/virgins/coeds/etc.  walk by.  At   Purdue University , these are the lions that roar when virgins go by.  Of course, to alums the most enduring symbol of the University was the old smokestack which was torn down the year after I graduated.  I don't have any pictures of the smokestack so the lions will have to do in its absence.      I met this goose while I was working at   Argonne National Labs .  Argonne is on a nature preserve and is very picturesque.  Known more to the outside residents for its unique herd of albino deer and to the interns for its  Evil and Agressive Swans , the only pictures I seem to have are of the geese.  Go figure!      People are some of my favorite animals.  The original of this photo just might be my favorite out of all those I've ever taken.  I caught these kids at a swim meet in Greenwood, IN.  I was coaching at the time but during the break between the morning and afternoon sessions the  pool was mostly deserted and I was able to take a few pics of these  girls in natural, childlike play.

"b"" Doug Hogue's Sheep Page           Douglas E. Hogue                    Two limitations of sheep production are the reproductive rates of ewes and  the seasonality of production.  The  STAR  sheep management  system has been developed to help solve these two problems.  It is a  systematic schedule with 5 lambing periods evenly spaced throughout the year for  continuity of production.  Each ewe can lamb 5 times in 3 years or 1.67 times a  year for increased production.  Coupling this increase in lambing frequency with  an increased lambing rate, we are now realizing an annual lamb production of  about 3 lambs per ewe.  The  STAR  was developed by Brian  Magee, Cornell Sheep Farm Manager, and the figure depicts the  STAR  """,3

Active in the San Francisco music scene since \tthe post-punk explosion of the mid-80\'s, both Rayburn and \tbassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk \tband Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently \treleased albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records.   \tBand member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged \tvocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two \tChris Isaak records (including the hit ""Wicked Game"") so \tmemorable.   \tViolinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose \tsolid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC, \tVan Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played.   \tTogether El Sob\'s quirky mix of stark yet dense lyrics and \tsweet and brooding music comprises the unique sounds you will \thear on this tape.

Combined with the unusual instrumention--squeaky pork chop, gargling, and animal noises--this discourse makes ""Skin a Cat"" one of El Sob\'s most popular live tunes.     LYRICS   Hey diddle the cat and the fiddle  Stick it out on Chicken Little  Lucy in the Sky and the Cat in the Hat  Don\'t waste your time on things like that   I ain\'t nothing like you  I ain\'t nothing like you   There\'s more than one way to skin a cat  I live till I die and I can\'t come back  Koo koo ca choo and the joke\'s on you  Laugh in their face \'cause the things they do   I ain\'t nothing like you  I ain\'t nothing like you   Do it like me, do it like me  Do it like me  It\'s better like me!   Up in the sky with a thousand eyes  Everyone\'s looking for love at first sight  There\'s more than one way to skin a cat  I live till I die and I can\'t come back   I ain\'t nothing like you  I ain\'t nothing like you   Be more like me, be more like me  Be more like me  It\'s better like me!     OTHER INFO (because we don\'t have any press reviews!)     El Sob...and Stuff    Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term ""Stuff Band"" to describe themselves because ""we\'re not afraid to play anything that might come our way while shopping at Thrift Town,"" says Christine Wall, who has been known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and a dog toy during the course of one song.  \t""I used to play a regular electric bass,"" adds Sally \tEngelfried, ""but I found it too limiting, so in searching for \tthe right sound I had one made for me."" The resulting \tone-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like \tresonance.  ""I\'m devoted to El Sob because this is the only \tband that lets me shake my tookus in public,"" comments John \tTenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in \taddition to his specialties of violin and mandolin.  Bruce \tRayburn, whose stuff most often comes from down-and-out \tcousins, has been known to write songs about stuff and his \tcousins. ""I got Christine\'s dumbek for her from an old \tgirlfriend who owed me,"" says Rayburn gleefully.     MERCHANDISE DESCRIPTION    \t  YOU\'VE HEARD ABOUT THE STUFF, NOW HEAR THE \tSTUFF!

"b'    LaFond, Lois                One World                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:47 mins, 2.72M, 5.45M)          Children\'s                                   LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES  PLAY THE WORLD BEAT!           Welcome to five cool albums from one hot band!   BIG TIME FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY  (and great for the classroom, too!)     Grab your make-believe microphone, put on your dancin\' shoes, get ready to celebrate: get down, have fun and learn something, too.  LOIS LaFOND  & THE ROCKADILES  offer you great grooves like Reggae,Rock, Brazilian,  African, Blues and even a Ballad or two, and blend them with child-appropriate  lyrics.The result is a World Beat sound the entire family will love.   These are songs of self-esteem with a dose of just-plain-silly tunes that celebrate cultures from around the world. Mostly, they\'re fun and  they\'re diverse and even teenagers have been seen tapping their feet. Plus, you can even learn something while you listen and move to the music. Some songs teach aboutlanguage and math, like ""Numbers All Around"" or  social studies such as ""Part of the Family."" Or you can just kick back and laugh  to songs like ""Wascawy Wabbit,"" or ""Up in the Sky Where the Whales Are.""   This happenin\' sound is recommended by everyone who is anyone,including  L.A.PARENT, PARENTS CHOICE, BILLBOARD, DOWNBEAT, American Library Association\'s  BOOKLIST,ALL EARS, and GROWING UP WITH MUSIC . . . So, what more could you want? Now just click on to hear a taste of this great sound or to order your own copies.               Biographical Information:    In 1984 Lois LaFond had two of the most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, who were four and five years old.  She searched high and low, in and out, up and down, by and through, far and wide, but couldn\'t find the kind of music she really liked made especially for Children (like smokin\' saxophones and percolatin\'percussion). So, being one to do whatever was necessary for those two most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, she decided to put out an album of her own with Reggae, Salsa, Blues,Ballads, Rock & Roll and African grooves. As she had been in the adult music scene for some number of years in the Boulder-Denver area, she had access to some of the greatest musicians to be found anywhere. And, as it worked out, in 1985, she had her third baby: I AM WHO I AM! This recording put her on the map as one of the premier American artists making modern music for young Children. At the same time she gathered four of Colorado\'s really rockin\' players and formed LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES -- one of the early five-piece bands to hit the road for Kids.   Now this World Beat sound satisfied those two gorgeous, talented and astounding Children, who also composed many of the songs with LaFond. Soon LaFond found out that many other Children-- as well as their parents -- were absolutely thrilled with her recording. People said things like, ""I really don\'t mind that my Child plays this tape over and over and over and over and over and over. I really like it, too!"" Reviews poured in from all over the country from newspapers and magazines, parents and teachers, and -- most importantly -- from Kids. I AM WHO I AM! became a signature tune which put LaFond in the forefront of composing and producing songs of self-esteem and diversity -- years before they were the buzzwords of today. Classrooms started using the music, as did Spinabifida Centers, ARC Centers and Very Special Arts Festivals around the country.   Encouraged by the response, LaFond decided to make another record in 1986. And another one in 1987. And another one in 1989. Each recording brought more rave reviews, positive comments and responses from publications like THE L.A.PARENT, PARENTS\' CHOICE, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE, DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, GRAMMY MAGAZINE, American Library Association\'s BOOKLIST, PRE-K TODAY, MUSIC EDUCATOR\'S JOURNAL, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL,  Jill Jarnow\'s ALL EARS, Laurie Sale\'s GROWING UP WITH MUSIC .. . . In fact, there were so  many reviews that there was no way to keep track of them anymore!   LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES\' songs were played on RADIO AAHS, WE LIKE KIDS of KTOO, Alaska,  PICKLEBERRY PIE out of Santa Cruz, WCBS-TV in New York, and on CONTINENTAL,LUFTHANSA, and DELTA Airlines Children\'s in-flight programming.   Of course, people started calling for shows with the ROCKADILES. So they toured their original  participatory concerts to thousands of Children from New York to Oregon and from                          Alaska to Florida at places like New York\'s CENTRAL PARK, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT, and ST.PETER\'S  CATHEDRAL.   Then, in 1995, LaFond produced her fifth album, TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN. So now the Rockin\'  ROCKADILES\' concerts include songs from this new recording as well as I AM WHO I AM! and their very popular ONE WORLD.   Soon LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES will be touring throughout COLORADO and in CHICAGO,  NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, and WASHINGTON, D.C. If you are in these areas, they might just be able to come to your community. You can call HEATHER NOTO at AGENCY WEST (303-652-3421) to bring ROCKADILES to YOUR town -- wherever you are!!   One thing Lois LaFond knows for sure is that every Child she gets to meet now is gorgeous, talented and astounding.      BAND MEMBER LIST:    LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES\' live show paints a rainbow of words that kids love, messages  that parents appreciate, and great music that pulls it all together in the World Beat.   Mother, singer, songwriter, producer, and speaker,  LOIS LaFOND  spent most of her life in the performance arts of dance, music, mime, and theatre, as well as teaching. Lois first made her mark in the adult world of music as vocalist and lyricist. She then brought her varied styles of music to the hearts of Children -- writing, producing, and recording five albums for Children and their families. Her sophisticated world music enjoys national acclaim from the L.A. PARENT and PARENTS\' CHOICE to BILLBOARD and DOWNBEAT magazines. Her songs appear on several international airlines and commercial and promotional videos. Her spoken voice is heard on voice-overs for video and radio productions as well as commercials. She is a featured speaker at NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN Conferences and sits on the faculty of THE PEOPLES NETWORK. Her many years of experience in the disciplines of teaching, music, and the performing arts combine to create the ultimate in entertainment for the entire family.    THE PLAYERS:    Drummer  GORDON KENNEDY  has been a musical mainstay in the ROCKADILES. He is featured on all of LaFond\'s recordings and in her opinion, ""Gordon has everything: great rhythm, keen ears,and a wild sense of humour."" Kennedy started drumming on  potato chip cans at 13. Now his styles range from rock to freeform improvisation with his current band, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. His drumming credits include, as he says, ""Too many bands to be significant."" He has opened for TALKING HEADS, THE RAMONES and KING SUNNY ADE. Kennedy says, ""With Children, there are no pretensions. It\'s just plain fun to work with THE ROCKADILES.""   Keyboardist  REBECCA MARTIN  began playing the piano at the age of six,and went on to earn a B.A. in Music and a Masters in Piano Performance and Pedagogy. Her talent for improvisation is seen in her jazz combo, THE REBECCA MARTIN TRIO, and the big band PANDAEMONIUM. She is an outstanding classical pianist who performs both solo and duet. She has taught piano for 21 years, specializing in the Suzuki method for young Children. Rebecca composed the piano music on LaFond\'s third tape SOMETHING NEW!   Bassist  CHICO MEIRA  also plays guitar, sings and composes. He began studying guitar as an eight year old child in Rio de Janeiro. The traditional music of Brazil which he brings to the band encompasses Samba, Bossa Nova, Chorinho, and African as well as Brazilian rhythms. He played in many rock bands in his native country and was the major force behind the band PAO BRASIL providing both classical guitar and vocals. Currently, in addition to ROCKADILES, he plays bass and percussion with CONGUEROS DEL ALMA while working as a full time bio-engineer.   Saxophonist  MARK HARRIS  has played everything from what he calls ""way-avante-honk-and- squeak music"" to the Colorado Symphony. Whatever the style, his preference is to play original music. His favorite style is world beat dance music with his band, MONKEY SIREN. Mark has played for shows with Bob Hope, Joe Williams, The Temptations, and Diane Schuur. He teaches sax at Metro State College of Denver and has appeared as a featured classical soloist with their wind ensemble. He performs on many recordings including those of Ron Miles, Fred Hess, and Janet Feder. He says, ""Kids are swell.""    MARK McCOIN  has played drums and percussion for 25 years gaining a national reputation for his musical scoring, art installations, and sound designs across the country. He has performed in America, Indonesia and Singapore. Mark has composed numerous theatre and dance scores for the DENVER CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS and the DAVID TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY. He founded the DENVER GAMELAN and was co-producer of the highly successful NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO series, TERRA INFIRMA. Mark has composed numerous original soundscapes.

I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kids some of what are called ""figures of speech"" in the English language, and this one is always a lot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter.   ""One World"" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called ""township jive."" When recording my Children\'s album, I thought ""One World"" would be a great choice to include for kids since it always got a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than I do for adults.      Press Reviews      About TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (song included online):     P.J.

Merchandise Description:    TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (LL-05c and LL-05cd) (Song ""Alliteration Sensation"" included online)   In this hot new release, LaFond does turn it all upside down. Continuing in her tradition of  cutting edge music, this new album replaces her big band sound with the essentials of music: vocals and percussion. LaFond has turned to an exciting array of over 40 percussion instruments from around the world including the Australian Didgeridoo, the Brazilian Berimbau and the American Washboard -- and everything in between. Singing of everything from numbers in three languages to a changeable creature named Zuppie, this recording also includes a parade, movement songs and a 5-minute relaxation process.   PLUS, based on LaFond\'s highly successful workshop: ""USING MUSIC IN THE CLASSROOM: YOU DON\'T HAVE TO BE BEETHOVEN,"" she has compiled a manual of hands-on ideas for Parents and Teachers to use the songs to teach all the disciplines including Language, Math, Art, Imagination, and more. Hailed by teachers and parents and, especially, kids. Geared for the Child 4-7.   Songlist:     Celebrate!  Alliteration Sensation  Stop & Go  Numbers All Around!

Before Paul Simon\'s GRACELAND was released, the Rockadiles were writing Afro-Pop songs for the highly successful Denver dance band for adults, ORCHESTRA KING MAMA. This sound is captured on ONE WORLD, which includes African/Caribbean-influenced music styles such as soca and mbaganga, as well as blues, gospel, jazz, klezmer,reggae, and ballads.

The songs emphasize movement, language, rhythm and ""just plain fun."" Applauded for their sophistication, this is music with a message to boot. With her eye always on self-esteem and diversity, LaFond includes two songs in French and Spanish. Child-oriented topics include ME!, animals, colors, space, and much much more. Geared for the Child 2-7.   Songlist:     I Am Who I Am!

As such, you are certainly aware of the coffee discovery legend. To review: A few hundred years ago some African goatherders saw their goats cavorting with unusual great enthusiasm. Investigating, the goatherders traced the behavior to the coffee cherries the goats were eating. From this they learned to make a new beverage called kaffe.   This is a lame story. Africa has been inhabited for thousands of centuries and just twenty generations ago people discovered coffee? Because for the first time goats decided to eat coffee beans? It\'s hincky! There is strong evidence to suggest that coffee is a new arrival on planet earth. It was brought here to wake people up. Soon after coffee was ""discovered"" coffee houses sprang up in Europe and in no time there was revolution. Freedom was in the air. Or more to the point, in the cup. Experience the   original wild coffees from Ethiopia. And you too will wake up.     THE X BEANS $9.95 per lb      Mail    '",2
"b'      95-09-14 REEL LIFE: Sean Penn, party of 20 (plus two goats)             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ eye WEEKLY                                           September 14 1995 Toronto\'s arts newspaper                      .....free every Thursday ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ REEL LIFE                                                    REEL LIFE     SEAN PENN, PARTY OF 20 (PLUS TWO GOATS)   by  LAURA LIND        Once again the city is stacked with famous actors. Of course, these people won\'t  be attending the film festival like the average Joe. They\'ll waltz from limos, through  lineups and into luxury hotels.    Reel Life was wondering just how far Toronto\'s service industry will go to show  these thespians a good time. Impersonating the personal managers of Uma  Thurman, Woody Allen and Sean Penn, Reel Life called some Toronto hotels,  restaurants and tourist attractions to find out.   Surprisingly, Uma Thurman couldn\'t even get a reservation for a room at the  Royal York. (We didn\'t get a chance to ask for a horse hair mattress.) And the  SkyDome\'s PR director Howard Starkman said Woody Allen could not play ""The  Star-Spangled Banner"" on the clarinet to open a Jays/Yankees game.    But Sean Penn\'s name opened doors very quickly at Bistro 990. This transcript  of the phone call tells it all.    eye:  Hi, I\'m calling on behalf of Sean Penn. I\'m trying to make a dinner  reservation for him on the 16th of September for a group of 20 at 9:30 p.m. We\'d  like a room that is private.    990: Let me look at my book. He doesn\'t want to sit with the public  downstairs?   eye:  Absolutely not.    990: I could put him upstairs, yeah, I can give him a private room. Is 9:30 after his  gala?   eye:  Yes.     990: I have a second floor so nobody will see you.    eye:  He\'s very sensitive -- he doesn\'t want any disruption. Especially not  photographers .    990: Definitely not. That\'s a policy -- I don\'t get them in there. I\'ll have security  guards at the door.    eye:  We\'d appreciate it if no one outside the immediate staff waiting on Mr. Penn  would know that he\'s in the restaurant.     990: No one will know. We\'ll keep that very quiet. Andy Garcia came in today --  nobody knew.    eye:  He\'d like to screen a few of his outtakes from feature films. We\'ll need a  projector and a small screen.    990: I do have a projector and a screen already in that room.   eye:  In terms of menu... Sean had goat\'s-head soup while filming Casualties Of  War in Malaysia. He talks about it all the time. Would you be able to do something  along those lines?    990: I\'ll have to talk to the chef. (To the chef) Can you make... Sean Penn would  like to have for dinner some goat head soup (sic)? The chef will look it up. We\'ll  find out what that is.   eye:  It\'s got a goat\'s head in it, apparently.    990: It sounds weird... but it could be tasty.   eye:  Could you slaughter the goat during the salad?     990: Slaughter the goat in the salad? A real goat in the restaurant and slaughter  it?   eye:  Like they do in Japanese restaurants.    990: OK, I have... I have to check what it requires for me to have. To be more  specific, you want the actual goat there, or...   eye:  Two goats. Two goats. It takes one day to cook the goat in the soup. But I  think he wants the appearance that the goat that was just slaughtered turns up in the  soup.     990: Oh. I see.   eye:  So you take the goat out, and sacrifice it and then take it away and come out  and serve the soup with a goat\'s head in it. Like a cooking show, with one live goat  in the dining room and a dead goat in the soup. I think he wanted that drama.    990: Literally pieces of the goat head?   eye:  Not the goat head that was just slaughtered but the day before.    990: I don\'t think we can do that.    eye:  So it would have to be pre-made?    990: We would have to look it up.   eye:  He wanted to do something shocking. He\'s talking to studio heads. Is there  any way to have a pi\xc2\xa4ata hung from the ceiling?    990: A real one?   eye:  Papier-m\xc2\x83ch\xc2\x82.    990: That I can probably get.   eye:  We\'d like it made in the shape of Madonna and filled with flies.    990: Filled with real flies? Alive?   eye:  Live flies.     990: A papier-m\xc2\x83ch\xc2\x82 pi\xc2\xa4ata made in the shape of Madonna filled with live flies? I  don\'t know. This is very confusing. What does he mean, the shape of  Madonna?   eye:  He wants Madonna the actress as opposed to Madonna the Virgin.     990: Madonna the singer in a pi\xc2\xa4ata. Does he want the face of Madonna?   eye:  The whole body. It doesn\'t matter which era.     990: OK, I\'ll see what we can do. I\'ll see if we can find a local artist to make the  pi\xc2\xa4ata. If the soup doesn\'t work we\'ll try something else. Other than that, are there  any other requests you have?       Unfortunately, after the goat sacrifice and the Madonna pi\xc2\xa4ata we couldn\'t think  of anything more bizarre, except maybe to ask if they had Prince Albert in a can.  Anyhow, Bistro 990 phoned back to say that he couldn\'t do the goat sacrifice  ""because I have parties afterwards and before.""     -30-                To  eye \'s Movie Features archives.

""Four stars out of three!""   - James Velvet,  WPLR Local Bands Show    ""This highly proficient quartet... plays darn well!""   - Christopher Arnott,  New Haven Advocate      What the Cat Dragged In  is an  unsigned  and flat broke band of Yale graduate students.  Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played  numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime Street Festival. The band\'s instrumentation includes (but is not limited to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums.   On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD,  Scratch Tracks .  This entirely independent release was  co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right).  The CD contains 12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics.    Big Love  is the first track off the CD to receive air time.   All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our music.  Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical  backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres. The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests.        Heather Nye : Keyboards, Percussion  Heather is a native of Vancouver, WA, a Duke alum, a fourth year   pharmacology major, and a first year med student.   She plays an Ensoniq KS-32 and a Yamaha DX-7. Her influences are jazz/pop oriented and include Bonnie Raitt, Maria McKee, David Wilcox, and David Sandborn.     Mark Cassano : Guitar  Mark is our resident guitar hero. He\'s a native of Danbury, CT and an NYU grad. Currently, he\'s finishing his degree in Economics while posing as a mild-mannered professor at Vassar.  He plays a Hamer Special (made back in the days when Hamer was still a designer in the company) and thinks Richard Thompson is the greatest guitar player  alive (but still listens to just about everything else.)        Marco Mazzi : Drums  Marco still lives in New London, CT, his hometown for life, and makes the hour long drive for practices, shows, and classes. An RPI grad, he\'s studying electrical engineering. Marco plays Slingerland drums, is a big time Marillion fan, and knows a few guys named Vinny.        John McEachen : Bass, Harmonica, Guitar  John hails from Woodbridge, VA and is also an electrical engineering major. A Notre Dame alum, he can consistently be found in front of the TV on Saturday afternoons.  John plays a 6-string Alembic Elan. A former member of the defunct bluegrass combo  Whistler\'s Brother , he has some pretty  hefty country/folk persuasions.                        '",0

Originating   from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for  several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major  forces in the international world of  music, God Dog is one of  the newer ""Tech Metal"" groups to burst upon the scene.    God Dog consists of  the electronic and vocal talents of  Steve  Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have  been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have  released a full-length independent CD, ""Of Love, Death and  Blood"", as well as performing several live shows.  The self  professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal  and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their  sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is  innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song  structure and melody.  God Dog will appeal to people who like  to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a  jagged tunnel.     With the addition of drummer, programmer and  synth master, Ben Padilla, God Dog are expanding their live  shows and adding a plethora of new sounds and styles to new  material while maintaining their Industrial edge.  Emphasis on  diversity and quality, a commitment to integrity, a  concentrated effort toward constant productivity and a growing  loyal fan base mean God Dog will be around for years to come.      \tBand info and the full-length 50min CD release, GOD DOG  ""Of Love, Death, and Blood"" is available by writing:        GOD DOG:   PO BOX 1124  SOQUEL, CA  95073      EMISSION:    \tEmission, showcasing the talents of God Dog, is a  combination of heavy guitar and driving beats interspersed with  quieter moments of synth and programming orchestration.  The   track is further enhanced by  layers of  electronic mayhem.   The songs lyrics, delivered in a heavily distorted yet unique  Industrial vocal style are about individuality and personal  expression while not getting weighed down by the opinions and  expectations of others.   \tAn over all intense and  aggressive song, God Dog feel it is one of the stronger tracks  off their new full-length independent CD release ""Of Love,  Death, and Blood"".

"b'    Crosswind                Fairytales                           (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:42 mins, 2.67M, 5.33M)          Rock                                                    After years of experience and dedication this swirling musical mass known as  Crosswind  now surges to gale force. Fed by an encouraging musical climate and drawing from potent wells of knowledge and ability, Crosswind has developed into a serious storm of sound and fury, ready to establish sovereignty. Quickly take this opportunity to examine the conditions and prevailing atmospheric circumstances that have merged and intersected to proudly produce Crosswind.   First there were simple honest goals which were almost always the truest direction to take. Often it takes a band or any collection of musicians a long time to arrive at that realization. Some never reach such a lofty level of understanding, but wallow hopelessly lost in bandwagon jumping, trend-observing confusion. Crosswind, however, is an example of a band whose members have come nearly full circle in development and found themselves staring squarely at the musical bottom line-- go with what you know!!   Diligently working thir way through ideas,expectations, views and objectives, often by way of countless ""hell gigs"" - the members of this bluesy guitar-driven rock ensemble: vocalist  Dana Hall , guitarist  Scottie Jordan , bass player  Rich Barefoot  and drummer  Dan Ross ; have been savvy enough to grasp the concept that experience, a good work ethic and a straightforward stand is often the only way to rock and roll heaven. Sadly, today, the industry weather report frequently features bands that are here today, gone later today Not Crosswind!   The band has gathered strength around a brooding, talented and misleading calm eye - lead vocalist Dana Hall. She is the focal center of the Crosswind storm. She and her compatriots know that while success would be wonderful, being good, really good, offers the greater reward. Thus, the die was cast, their lot thrown together.   Crosswind was originally born out of the demise of several other Charlotte, N.C.-area bands. ""We were scared,"" Dana admits, ""we had to start over from scratch. Now, we\'ve done a lot of road work, that has helped me to understand the idea of entertainment. Now it feels so good to be up there singing for other people, not for me -- but for everybody out there!""   With well over 300 gigs under their belt, Crosswind has established a solid live show and appeared alongside major regional and national acts (yes, some of these bands are still around!) such as: .38 Special, Mothers Finest, Kansas, Nightranger, The Outlaws, Steppenwolf, Copperhead, Molly Hatchet, Three Dog Night, The Georgia Satellites and Cry of Love.   Calling Crosswind a ""Southern-fried version of The Who"" Jordan believes that the availability of the bands music is a big part of the success equation. To fulfill that requirement, Crosswind recorded nine original songs on a cassette album entitled ""Can You Feel It?"" that they plan to distribute ""everywhere possible"".  Recorded at White Room Studios in Charlotte, the new music on ""Can You Feel It?"" is a real representation of the soul of Crosswind.""Our sound is simple"", says Hall. ""We write what we feel, not what we think we\'re expected to write."" Calling the band\'s sound a mixture of Southern rock, anthem rock, the blues and hard rock, she adds ""This band has lots of energy. We pour it out onto the audiences in much the same fashion as a lot of 70\'s bands. We feed off the crowd and in return the crowd feeds off us.""    PRESS REVIEWS     Their better original stuff leans toward moody Led Zeppelin and raucous Aerosmith and steers clear of wimpy Journey-isms. Dana Hall has a strong rock n\' roll voice, and they avoid the pretentious, ridiculous, stage-strutting monkeyshines of so many hard rockers.   -  Charlotte Observer , September 25 1993    Crosswind delivers straight ahead rock n\' roll as subtly as a slap in the face. A listen to the band\'s cassette ""Can You Feel It?"" proves us right. We felt it.   -  Asheville Citizen-Times , January 13, 1995    This Charlotte outfit mixes some solid guitar crunch, an attitude that\'s aggressive without being threatening and the pipes of CL Best of Charlottes Best Female Vocalist winner Dana Hall.   -  Creative Loafing  February 1994       "" Can You Feel It?

This is not your average folksinger.    Eileen  got her start performing in comedy clubs in  California. Although she did well in competitions, she wanted  to emphasize her music as much as her humor, something that is  not possible in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy.   When she moved east,  Eileen  concentrated on the music scene,  quickly becoming a regular performer at folk festivals and  coffeehouses. In addition to the humorous songs she brought  with her, she began to write satirical songs about the culture  shock of living in Washington, D.C., after growing up in  California.

"b' Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death        Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death     Hello and Welcome!     This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements.  My name is  Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu)  and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale.  Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field.  (See below.)    I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death.  This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation.  Soon I will put more information about my work here.     An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle.  The heart is comprised of four chambers.  Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right).  The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract.  On the electrocardiogram ""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen.  Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation.  Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously.  During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart.       This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor  (It is a postscript file.)      I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future.  One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially.          To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF:   I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis.  Email me at denner@yale.edu or use my  email reply form .  Also, if you are just browsing this page or my other WWW pages, let me know what you think!

"b'     Blade Runner / Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?    What Book is   Based on?   Blade Runner is loosely based on a   Philip K. Dick :  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep  ( DADoES ).  The least one can say about the film adaptation is that it borrowed a number of concepts and characters from the book.  Dick also wrote the short story that    Total Recall   was based on,  We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale .  A recurring theme in Dick\'s work is the question of personal and human identity.   A question explored more in  DADoES  and  Total Recall  than in  Blade Runner  is ""what is reality?""   You are most likely to find  DADoES  in a second-hand bookstore.  It has been re-printed as:  Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) .   The title comes from Alan E. Nourse, who wrote a story called  The Bladerunner .   William S. Burroughs  took the book and wrote  Bladerunner (A Movie)  in 1979. Rights to the title only (""in perpetuity"") were sold to   Ridley Scott .  Similarities between Nourse\'s  The Bladerunner  and Scott\'s  Blade Runner  are in name only.  Nourse\'s title refers to people who deliver medical instruments to outlaw doctors who can\'t obtain them legally. Scott thought the title made a good codename for Deckard.   Some of the ""visuals"" were inspired by a story from   Dan O\'Bannon  and Moebius (  Jean Giraud ) called    The Long Tomorrow   in an issue of the French  Wonders of the Universe  comic book series.  The back of the comic book says (translated from French):         This comic-book also contains other famous stories,       like ""The Long Tomorrow"", which originally was thought       to be a parody, but ended up being more real, than what       it was meant to be a parody of: the classic American       detective-story.  This story was later used as a visual       reference for the movie ""Blade Runner.""   Giraud did the costume design for the Walt Disney movie  Tron , for which   Syd Mead  did the mechanical design.            Murray    muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au  '",3

The professionals we saw could not identify his illness.  We spent huge sums of money searching for an answer.  When his disorder was finally diagnosed, we learned that it was so rare, physicians knew little about it.  There seems to be no treatment, and very little research giving us hope for his future.""  Although this parent thought her story was unique, millions of Americans with rare disorders have suffered similar agonies.  Names of their illnesses may be different, but most have experienced the indignity of searching for help in vain.  Rare disorders are ""back of the textbook"" illnesses, unfamiliar to the general public and professionals alike.  They can strike people of all ages, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds.  Many are genetic; others are acquired through environmental causes. But for most, the cause is still unknown.  Thus, even after a family obtains a proper diagnosis, they are too often left with more unanswerable questions.

"b'     Arthur\'s Column        Arthur\'s Column    Of goats and men ...     Week ending 20th August 1995.     Firstly, thank you to Gabriel for handling the gruelling task of writing this column for the past three weeks.  As you will have noticed, Gabriel is a talented writer who rose to this task with admirable liquidity.  His other work can be perused in  The Column Nobody Reads...    Which brings me to the theme of this week\'s column.  What, you may ask, have goats to do with merriment and London.  Well, the answer is lies in the former.  Last week I was fortunate to be in Liechtenstein for their annual holiday (held appropriately on the birthday of the local prince), and am now able to report on some of the antics that occured.   Getting plastered appears to be the principal feature of the day (along with bands, a fair etc.), and yours truly rose to the occasion together with various friends who happened to be there.  What started out as an innocent few pints rapidly degenerated into a rather decent party.  It is on what happened under the cover of darkness, however, that your columnist must report.   There is this field.  It has four goats.  Not large ones, rather the cute brown type that one stops to pat on one\'s morning run.  In fact, one had stopped and patted said goats that very morning.  Which lead to the statement sometime later that day ...  ""Wonder what the goats will look like in London Mall T Shirts""  (we had a few).  Not thinking more about it the day drew to its predictable close and I retired to bed.  A little later some of the younger members of the crew appeared at the house.   ""Got to come and see the goats!"" .    You guessed it.  Four cute brown goats dressed in T Shirts.  This is where the fun started.   Sensing the farmer\'s imminent disapproval wifey instructed said crew members to remove said T Shirts.  An easy task, you would think, particularly for such experienced goat dressers as these.  What they hadn\'t counted on was the arrival of one very large non-cute billy goat who, leaping the electric fence with ease, took control of the paddock, T Shirts, crew members, goats and all.  By taking control you can infer ""asserted authority"".  Within seconds the team were scrabbling down 30 foot drops where even goats are smart enough not to tread.  Battered and bruised they repaired to the house, wondering whether the Billy could negotiate the complex Swiss locks on the front door.   On more local issues I went to the   Anchor Bankside   today for a pint and lunch.  I have written about this pub before - singing its praises etc.  I now have to rescind everything.  There are lots of tables outside where you can sit and enjoy a great view of the Thames, obscured only by the back of a 4 foot banner proclaiming the pub\'s presence to the river.  Unfortunately the tables are dirty, and the area is not kept clean.  Inside, the queue for lunch at 14.00 was long and very slow.  After spending the obligatory 30 minutes waiting to be served by unenthusiastic bar staff the food is virging on the inedible.   Its a real shame that a pub with such heritage, clearly on the tourist maps, has become such a poor example of a British pub.   Speaking of pubs, on my pub-crawl towards home yesterday afternoon I had the opportunity to stop in at   Dogget\'s Coat and Badge   on the south side of the Thames just west of Blackfriar\'s bridge.  Not worthy of a visit, I shall grade it 1 in the  Pub Guide .  I also had occasion to visit   The Founders Arms   on the South bank just east of Blackfriars.  This is a reasonable pub, worthy of a 4.  It has a great view of the river, but is unfortunately very modern looking and rather boring architecturally.  Worth a pint just for the view though.   Thats all for now...       Part 2 was published the following month      Why not send a letter (email) to the editor?!?  Send all mail to  arthur@micromedia.co.uk .  You too could become famous!     Take a look at the  Pub Guide  while you\'re in the neighbourhood!

"b""     Sheep - VegSocUK Information Sheet       The Vegetarian Society UK   Sheep   Information Sheet           Introduction  --  Sheep Production  --  Transport & Slaughter  --  Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding  --  Wool          Introduction    There are around 44 million sheep in the UK national flock including about 50 pure breeds and 300 crossbreeds. Over 22 million are lambs under one year of age whilst 17 million are breeding ewes. Most sheep are slaughtered as lambs.   Whilst sheep appear to have been less affected by intensive farming practices compared with other farm animals their rearing can still involve considerable suffering and welfare problems.       Sheep Production    Ewes are first mated in their first or second years. Ewes naturally come into heat in autumn or winter and gestation period is about five months meaning lambs are born in spring or summer when the weather is warmer and grass is growing. However this can be altered by controlled breeding with ewes being brought into heat by administering hormones. This means lambs can be born throughout the year providing a constant supply to market.   Rams are usually from special breeding farms. A single ram will usually serve 30 to 60 ewes. Artificial insemination is uncommon in sheep though new techniques are being developed to make it more efficient.   Ewes generally lamb once per year though selective breeding has meant some can lamb twice per year. Breeding has also encouraged ewes to have twins or triplets rather than a single lamb. If a ewe has only a single lamb the unborn lamb may grow too large to pass through the narrow birth canal, sheep having been bred to be smaller. Many farmers may choose to cut the front legs off the live lamb whilst still in the womb. This is called embryotomy and is carried out to avoid having to pay a vet to perform a caesarean. The practice is widespread and more than 50,000 lambs are believed to be killed in this manner during the lambing season.   Around 4 million lambs die each year. Exposure, hypothermia, starvation and disease account for most of these. Sometimes there may be too many lambs in the flock (due to multiple births or the death of ewes.) These orphan lambs may be auctioned at markets at only a few days old. These lambs are especially prone to disease and mortality is high. 35,000 orphan lambs are sent to market during the lambing season.   A trend towards intensification means lambs are weaned earlier, fed on milk substitute and feed concentrates and housed indoors. Indoor housing has lead to increasing disease problems including coccidiosis, watery mouth and sheep lice.   Male lambs are castrated before three months old. The commonest method is by the application of a tight rubber ring cutting off the blood supply. Castration can occur without anaesthetic in lambs up to three months provided the ring is applied within the first week of life. The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) stated in 1992 that castration by means of a rubber ring causes considerably greater pain than the alternative clamping method which is sometimes used. Acute pain lasts for several hours following application of the ring. Sometimes castration may be performed surgically using a knife. Again, this can be carried out without anaesthetic or a vet being present. Tail docking of lambs may also occur without anaesthetic.   Between 15-25% of ewes are culled each year because of lameness, poor health or failing to lamb. These are replaced in the flock. Flock stocking densities are steadily increasing. This is causing environmental problems in upland areas as overgrazing by sheep leads to loss of vegetation and soil erosion.   In common with other farm animals, sheep suffer from a wide range of diseases. The commonest is foot-rot which often results in lameness. Foot-rot is encouraged by a high stocking density in housing and pens. Lameness can also be caused by other infectious diseases and is a major  welfare problem in sheep.   Sheep scab and myiasis (blowfly strike) are distressing and potentially fatal contagious diseases in sheep. These are prevented by sheep dipping. Sheep dipping was made compulsory twice a year in 1985 but made non-compulsory again in 1992. Sheep dips contain toxic organophosphates which are believed to be responsible for a high incidence of severe illness in farmers. The possible toxic effects of sheep dips on the sheep themselves has not been studied.   Other diseases affecting sheep include mastitis, toxoplasmosis, liver fluke and scrapie (related to BSE in cattle). Many sheep suffer from pneumonia and hypothermia during the winter when exposed to harsh weather conditions. This is a particular problem for sheep in upland areas. Around 40% of sheep in the UK live in hard upland conditions where winter hand feeding is restricted and shelter minimal.   Some sheep are housed indoors during the winter in enclosed sheds or barns. These may be poorly lit with concrete or slatted floors.       Transport & Slaughter    Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter. Over 1.3 million sheep and lambs were exported live in 1992 and this figure is predicted to increase to between 2.5 and 3.5 million in 1993. 82% of live sheep are exported to France.   Sheep are crammed into lorries so tightly packed that they may be unable to turn around or lie down. They may be exposed to extreme weather conditions. Heatstroke, hypothermia and pneumonia are common. Journeys can last 24 hours or more during which time the sheep are neither fed or watered. This is extremely distressing for the animals and mortality is high.   In Britain, most sheep go to slaughter via markets rather than direct from the farm. This can increase the stress animals experience as well as increasing the incidence of injury. Over 19 million sheep were slaughtered in the UK in 1992. Over 90% of these were lambs of varying ages.   Sheep are slaughtered by electrical stunning followed by neck-cutting. Stunning may often be ineffective and sheep may regain consciousness during bleeding-out or even before throat-slitting. Stunning by firing a captive bolt into the animals head is regarded as a more effective method but is not often used in British abattoirs due to being more costly.       Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding    Mulesing and tooth-grinding of sheep is prohibited in the UK but is widespread elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Much of the lamb consumed and wool used in Britain is imported from these countries.   Australia is the world's leading sheep producer and exporter with a national flock of an estimated 135 million sheep. Mortality is high, at around 8 million sheep per year. Around 100 million sheep suffer from mulesing each year. Mulesing involves the slicing away of folds of skin from beneath the sheep's tail which forms a wool-free scar and so prevents blowfly strike (blowflies laying their eggs in the damp wool and the larvae eating into the flesh of the living sheep). This is carried out without anaesthetic and causes severe and prolonged pain. Mulesing is carried out because it is seen as being cheaper and easier than alternatives such as regular shearing of wool.   Tooth-grinding of older sheep is also routine. Tooth-grinding is supposed to reduce the number of ewes prematurely culled due to broken teeth. It involves a rotary stone cutting machine to slice off the ewe's front teeth through the pulp almost down to the gum. In the UK, tooth-grinding was carried out by a less severe method involving shortening the front teeth with less likelihood of cutting through sensitive tissue. However, this practice is now illegal in the UK.       Wool    Wool production in the UK tends to be a by-product of the meat industry, the wool produced being of low quality. Wool accounts for 5-10% of the total value of a ewe. Most British wool is used for coarse fabrics such as carpets. Wool production in Britain was 72 million kg in 1992.   Sheep are first sheared at around 14 months old. Lambs of some breeds may be clipped to provide lambswool. The entire fleece is sheared in one piece. Sheep have been selectively bred to produce a thick fleece and need to be sheared in early summer to prevent heatstroke. Wild sheep do not need to be sheared.   Nearly one-third of British wool is from slaughtered sheep (mostly lambs). This is called skin wool. Skins from lambs also provide high value leather.

No Winter was born in the Fall of 1979 in Aptos, California as a quartet. After stormy beginnings,  the dust cleared and a tight, enduring trio (Robert, Jim and Dave) emerged called AURORA BOREALIS.  Early original music had wide influences and took shape in arrangements which balanced song with intricate  instrumental passages. As the band began to perform, numerous cover tunes crossing most musical  boundaries (From Alabamas to Zeppelins) were added to the repertoire. This helped to keep a ride range  of rooms filled, dancing, happy and intact. Always between the covers lurked the original songs.    Throughout the years the band evolved, mutated, went into oblivion and returned from oblivion, leading to the current project - an eight song CD/Cassette. This was produced with two living in Northern  California and the other in Southern California. Three of these songs are showcased here and the others  are: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Haven\'t I Cried Enough  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Queen of the Rodeo     In Heaven    I need some Lovin\'    Message to the stars    No Winter perpetually looks for musical/recording/exposure/performance opportunities.

"b' HospitalWeb              Welcome to  HospitalWeb , a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.   This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing  potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a  simple  and  globally accessible way for  patients ,  medical researchers , and  physicians  to get information on any hospital  in the world is the goal.      This list is of ""main"" webservers (only  webservers  at  hospitals  will be  listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online  (due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without  ""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will  include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of  a hospital webserver, please  send me mail  and I will add it immediately!   This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital  that doesn\'t have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).    Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List!  I\'ve just set up a  listserv  for HospitalWeb.

Although I\'ve seen  many  medical resources on the Web, I\'ve  never  seen a  simple and complete list  of hospitals  on the web.

"b'    Andrews, Jim                Doppelwerk                           (Excerpt 166k, 249k / Full song 5 mins, 3.59M, 7.18M)          Instrumental ,   Easy Listening                                        Jim Andrews      Jim is a native of Charlotte, North Carolina, and moved to Nashville in 1982 to attend Belmont College where he graduated with a Bachelors degree in Music Business in 1985.  Having performed various types of Music, he then began to record solo acoustic guitar pieces which were compiled for his first release ""Storytale"" in 1988.     While searching for a new and unique medium, Jim began composing music for Doppelgitarre (a type of German harp guitar) in 1989.  Having been introduced to engineer/producer Howard Toole in 1989, the two decided to co-produce an album.  ""Music For Doppelgitarre"" was released in 1990.  Jim performed in various places in Tennessee, then moved back to Charlotte in 1991.  Since that time, Jim has been performing in various venues in the southeast, as well as composing instrumental music for the forthcoming release ""Pure White Monday"" and guitar/vocal music for his performances and future recordings.     ""Music for Doppelgitarre"" is a collection of ten solo doppelgitarre pieces.  The music is very melodic in structure, and intended to convey a sense of serenity, color, and warmth.  As stated in a review by Guitar Player magazine, ""perfect for a morning cup of Java or an evening of quiet solitude.""  ""Pure White Monday"", however,  is more diverse containing different musical styles including pieces for guitar,  doppelgitarre, guitar synthesizer, and piano.  Jim\'s vocal music is rather like ""introspective folk"", with lyrics to ""live by"" and both flowing and aggressive guitar phrases.     To order ""Music for Doppelgitarre"" send $14.00 for CD or $9.00 for cassette plus $1.50 shipping to CIR,  P.O. Box 12505, Charlotte, NC 28220.  ""Pure White Monday"" is not yet released as Jim is looking for a record company with interest in marketing it.  For bookings or industry information, call 704/344-1819 or e-mail jandrews@cybernetics.net.           Songs included on IUMA       ""Momentum""   from ""Music for Doppelgitarre""        The mood for this piece is described by its title.  It contains intricate phrases with harp string melodies mixed with quick guitar picking.  The melody, as always, is evident as it strikes the contemplative side of the listener.       ""Serenity""  -  a live guitar/vocal recording        The title is somewhat ironic, as this is one of the more aggressive pieces.  It represents a good example of the diversity found in one of Jim\'s performances.      ""Doppelwerk""   from ""Pure White Monday""        This piece contains contrasting phrases from the doppelgitarre and piano.  The movement continues a steady pace throughout the song, and the song was titled ""Doppelwerk"" as it sounds like a more melodic, acoustic version of a well known German techno band.

"b""     Katya Reimann's Visual Work        VISUAL WORK       The plan is for this to be a revolving gallery of my paintings and drawings, with  occasional updates when I have produced new work that is good enough to dicker about with and get scanned in.     New! A sketchbook of black wash watercolors from a monthlong trip I took to India in December 1993.        Sketchbook of India Watercolors                                                                                   Life scenes        Influenced by Edward Hopper, this depicts a beach house after a huge storm along the coast.       This gate led down into a garden that I never got to go into.       I did a series of paintings of the small plastic animals that I'd grown up with as a child.  My motivation for this was wanting to paint animals that cast shadows and not having the mobility to go out to a zoo.       'Chinese Generals'  I painted this at the same time I was taking a course in Chinese Art History and  learning about how the Chinese painters used animals and other images drawn from nature to express political parables.  The instructor caught my attention with a story about two Chinese generals at the time of the Mongol invasion (c. 1272).  One ended up collaborating with the invaders, the other relinquished all his titles and wealth and went up into the mountains to herd goats.  A well-known master painter illustrated this with a simple brush drawing of a sheep and a goat, the animals symbolizing the respective spirits of these generals.  I painted a lot of bad paintings of sheep and goats before I managed to get this one good one.  Whether or not it ended up being anything about Chinese generals is another story....       Fantasy Images        This was my Christmas card one year when I was still stubborn enough to try to color cards up for all my friends.       The inspiration for this was an Italian hill town, but I think it does suggest stepping into a far off city in a fantastic world.       This is my King and Queen of Cups.  The poses are nicked from the card that  symbolizes 'The Lovers' in the fifteenth century Visconti Tarot deck.  She carries the magic cup that wells up with its own source of water; He carries the magic cup that is the stuff of the seas--when he ruffles the water within the cup, a storm appears upon the seas...

"b' Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death        Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death     Hello and Welcome!     This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements.  My name is  Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu)  and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale.  Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field.  (See below.)    I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death.  This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation.  Soon I will put more information about my work here.     An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle.  The heart is comprised of four chambers.  Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right).  The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract.  On the electrocardiogram ""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen.  Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation.  Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously.  During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart.       This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor  (It is a postscript file.)      I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future.  One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially.          To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF:   I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis.
